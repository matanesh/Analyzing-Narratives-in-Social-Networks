"00:22:13,234","00:22:16,109
",You know the Youth International Party as the Yippies.
"00:22:16,859","00:22:19,525
",Their leaders are Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin.
"00:22:19,609","00:22:22,984
",Bobby Seale is the leader of the Black Panther Party.
"00:22:23,567","00:22:27,400
","Again, the defendants would tell you that these are three distinct groups."
"00:22:27,484","00:22:29,317
",- But they all-- - Excuse me.
"00:22:29,400","00:22:30,234
",Yes.
"00:22:30,317","00:22:32,442
","- May I speak? - No, sir."
"00:22:32,525","00:22:33,609
",He just said my name.
"00:22:33,692","00:22:37,442
",You're a defendant in this case. You're likely to hear your name.
"00:22:37,525","00:22:41,275
","I have a right to counsel, and His Honor knows that."
"00:22:41,359","00:22:45,525
",Don't tell the court what it does and does not know. Be seated.
"00:22:48,859","00:22:50,234
",Mr. Schultz.
"00:22:54,192","00:22:55,609
",The radical left. That's all.
"00:22:55,692","00:22:57,734
",They're the radical left in different costumes.
"00:22:57,817","00:22:59,567
","These defendants had a plan,"
"00:22:59,650","00:23:02,484
",and a plan among two or more people is a conspiracy.
"00:23:03,067","00:23:05,692
",The defendants crossed state lines to execute their plan.
"00:23:05,775","00:23:09,317
","That's why we're in federal court, and the plan was to incite a riot,"
"00:23:09,400","00:23:11,734
",and there's one thing you already know.
"00:23:12,484","00:23:13,567
",They succeeded.
"00:23:13,650","00:23:18,692
",Excuse me. Have we identified the other defendants for the record?
"00:23:19,525","00:23:21,192

",What's going on here?
"00:23:28,359","00:23:30,734
","Uh, you're referring to the defendant Dellinger."
"00:23:30,817","00:23:34,067
","- Derringer. - Um, it's Dellinger, sir."
"00:23:34,150","00:23:39,275
",Note the prosecution was referring to the defendant Derringer.
"00:23:39,359","00:23:41,900
","- Not Dellinger. - It is Dellinger, Your Honor."
"00:23:41,984","00:23:43,900
",Can we straighten this out?
"00:23:43,984","00:23:47,817
",Sure. Dillinger was a bank robber. Derringer is a gun.
"00:23:47,900","00:23:50,900
","He's David Dellinger, and the judge and I are not related."
"00:23:50,984","00:23:54,484
","Your Honor, I'd like to caution the court that this kind of disruption"
"00:23:54,567","00:23:58,150
",and display of disrespect will be a continuing tactic for defense.

","Sir, it's not a tactic. At the moment,"
"00:24:00,567","00:24:03,734
",the defendants are the only ones on record as knowing their own names.
"00:24:03,817","00:24:05,567
","Be seated, Mr. Schultz..."
"00:24:05,650","00:24:07,817
","Uh, Mr. Kunstler."
"00:24:09,859","00:24:12,275
",I object to being characterized as a member of this group.

",Mr. Kunstler.
"00:24:37,484","00:24:39,650
",You are sitting right next to the man.
"00:24:39,734","00:24:42,109
",Just represent him. It's the same case.
"00:24:42,192","00:24:45,025
",The fact that there's a lawyer near Mr. Seale
"00:24:45,109","00:24:47,609
",does not satisfy the requirements of due process.
"00:24:47,692","00:24:48,775
",I have a right--
"00:24:48,859","00:24:53,817
",A motion was made for postponement due to Mr. Garry's medical condition.
"00:24:53,900","00:24:56,609
",I was there. Your Honor denied that motion.
"00:24:56,692","00:24:59,775
","Therefore, Mr. Seale is here without legal representation."
"00:24:59,859","00:25:04,650
","I don't care for your general tone, Mr. Kunstler."
"00:25:04,734","00:25:07,025
",I meant no disrespect to the court.
"00:25:07,109","00:25:11,567
",I'm trying to be clear that I can't muddy Mr. Seale's grounds for appeal
"00:25:11,650","00:25:13,484
",by appearing to speak as his lawyer.
"00:25:13,567","00:25:17,025
","I don't ask you to compromise Mr. Seale's position, sir."
"00:25:17,109","00:25:21,400
",But I will not permit him to address the jury
"00:25:21,484","00:25:23,942
",when his perfectly competent lawyer is sitting--
"00:25:24,025","00:25:26,400
","For the fourth time, he's not Bobby's lawyer."
"00:25:28,817","00:25:31,275

"00:25:31,942","00:25:33,025
","Yes, sir."

","Your Honor, I'm not with these guys."
"00:25:39,234","00:25:42,234
",I never met most of them until the indictment.
"00:25:42,317","00:25:44,650
",- We will have order. - There are eight of us here.
"00:25:44,734","00:25:48,692

"00:25:48,775","00:25:52,775
","- Mr. Marshal, will you seat Mr. Seale? - Conspiracy? I never met most of them."
"00:25:52,859","00:25:56,484
","Frankly, the US attorney wanted a Negro defendant to scare the jury."
"00:25:56,567","00:25:58,984
",I was thrown in to make the group look scarier.
"00:25:59,067","00:26:01,109
",I came to Chicago. I made a speech!
"00:26:01,192","00:26:02,942
","- Mr. Seale-- - I had a chicken pot pie,"
"00:26:03,025","00:26:05,359
","went to the airport and I flew back to Oakland,"
"00:26:05,442","00:26:06,984

",Get your hands off me!
"00:26:08,984","00:26:12,817
",Charge Mr. Seale with one count of contempt of court.
"00:26:38,525","00:26:40,192
","We have to make a decision right now,"
"00:26:40,275","00:26:44,317
",a decision I assumed we'd already made four months ago when trial prep began.
"00:26:44,400","00:26:48,650
",Are we using this trial to defend ourselves against very serious charges
"00:26:48,734","00:26:50,484
",that could land us in prison for ten years?
"00:26:51,567","00:26:54,484
","Or to say a pointless ""fuck you"" to the establishment?"
"00:26:54,567","00:26:57,650
",- Fuck you! - That is what I was afraid...
"00:26:58,525","00:27:01,525
","- Were you saying ""fuck you"" or answering-- - I was also confused."
"00:27:01,609","00:27:05,109
","If we leave without saying anything about why we came in the first place,"
"00:27:05,192","00:27:06,275
",it'll be heartbreaking.
"00:27:06,359","00:27:08,692
","If the jury finds us guilty, we're not leaving at all."
"00:27:08,775","00:27:11,359
",The only thing we need to say about why we came here
"00:27:11,442","00:27:13,192
",is it wasn't to incite violence.
"00:27:13,984","00:27:14,984
",I'm with Jerry.
"00:27:16,067","00:27:18,692
",- Why? - The trial shouldn't be about us.
"00:27:18,775","00:27:22,234
","I would love it if it wasn't about us, but it definitely is. John? Lee?"
"00:27:22,859","00:27:24,609
",Does anyone think our judge is crazy?
"00:27:24,692","00:27:27,150

"00:27:27,234","00:27:31,150
","I'm talking about us. Abbie, you cannot talk back to the judge."
"00:27:31,234","00:27:34,567
","- And, Jerry... Jesus! - Did you get a haircut just for court?"
"00:27:35,984","00:27:38,900
",- I did. - A haircut for the judge. That is...
"00:27:39,650","00:27:41,984
",I can't even. That is...
"00:27:42,067","00:27:43,734
",That is so foreign to me.
"00:27:43,817","00:27:45,317
",- So is soap. - Zing.
"00:27:45,400","00:27:48,567
",Let me explain something. It took you two less than five minutes
"00:27:48,650","00:27:52,400
",to make us look exactly like what Schultz is trying to make us look like.
"00:27:52,484","00:27:54,609
",I don't have a problem with what we look like.
"00:27:54,692","00:27:57,275

",- Lee? - Yeah.
"00:27:58,525","00:28:02,109
",- I feel like I'm ten pounds too heavy. - I don't like it when we fight.
"00:28:02,192","00:28:03,984
",- Rennie? - Tom should be heard.
"00:28:04,067","00:28:05,067
",And he was.
"00:28:05,609","00:28:10,109
","When we walked in here, they were chanting that the whole world is watching."
"00:28:10,192","00:28:11,900
",This is it. We're on.
"00:28:11,984","00:28:16,150
",This is what revolution looks like. Real revolution. Cultural revolution.
"00:28:16,234","00:28:17,775
",Why did you come here?
"00:28:17,859","00:28:19,775
",I got an invitation from a grand jury.
"00:28:19,859","00:28:21,900
",Last summer. Why did you come to the convention?
"00:28:22,900","00:28:24,400
",To end the war.
"00:28:24,484","00:28:26,734
","Guys, before you tether yourselves to this man,"
"00:28:26,817","00:28:30,234
",just know the very last thing he wants is for the war to end.
"00:28:30,317","00:28:35,317
",I don't have time for cultural revolution. It distracts from actual revolution.
"00:28:35,400","00:28:37,234
","All right, all right, all right."
"00:28:37,317","00:28:39,234
",But you got time for a haircut.
"00:28:39,317","00:28:41,234
",Has everybody got everything off their chest?
"00:28:41,817","00:28:44,400
",- What in the name of hell was that? - Evidently not.
"00:28:44,484","00:28:45,942
",You spoke for Bobby.
"00:28:46,025","00:28:48,442

",- I think I will anyway. - Fred--
"00:28:52,692","00:28:54,942

",White guys sitting in a furnished room eating sandwiches while Bobby's in a cell.
"00:29:00,609","00:29:02,775
",White guys are free on bail. Bobby's locked up
"00:29:02,859","00:29:05,650
",because he's under arrest in Connecticut for killing a cop.
"00:29:05,734","00:29:08,609
",It's not like he refused to give up his seat on a bus.
"00:29:08,692","00:29:12,442
","Convince him to let Bill and me represent him, just for today, at least."
"00:29:12,525","00:29:13,984
",- The judge is-- - Fucking nuts.
"00:29:14,067","00:29:17,275
",A little hostile. I'm sure Garry didn't anticipate that.
"00:29:19,359","00:29:20,567
",He's innocent in Connecticut.
"00:29:20,650","00:29:22,525
",- All right. - He's never killed anyone.
"00:29:22,609","00:29:24,984
",- It's important that you all know that. - Okay.
"00:29:25,067","00:29:28,150

"00:29:48,359","00:29:51,859
",This is a political trial that was already decided for us.
"00:29:52,400","00:29:55,067
",Ignoring that reality is just weird to me.
"00:29:55,150","00:29:58,359
",There are civil trials and there are criminal trials.
"00:29:58,442","00:30:00,650
",There's no such thing as a political trial.
"00:30:00,734","00:30:01,817
",Okay.
"00:30:18,400","00:30:20,275

"00:30:49,817","00:30:52,150
",There would be thousands of young people attending

",There's gonna be a festival of life in Grant Park held during the convention.

",about seeking indictments against my clients?
"01:25:01,942","01:25:03,775
",- He can't answer that. - Why not?

",It's against the law.
"01:25:04,942","01:25:08,025
",That's an overly broad interpretation of the law.
"01:25:08,109","01:25:09,984
",- If you'd like-- - I'll tell you what.
"01:25:10,067","01:25:12,275
","We've dealt with jury tampering, wiretapping,"
"01:25:12,359","01:25:14,525
","a defendant that was literally gagged,"
"01:25:14,609","01:25:17,275
",and a judge who's been handing down rulings from the bench
"01:25:17,359","01:25:19,609
",that would be considered wrong in Honduras.
"01:25:19,692","01:25:23,900
",So I'm a little less interested in the law than I was when this trial began.
"01:25:23,984","01:25:29,359
","Well, whether you like the law or not, as former AG, he is protected by it."
"01:25:29,442","01:25:31,150

",Find a judge in this circuit who will sign that subpoena.
"01:25:37,817","01:25:41,567
