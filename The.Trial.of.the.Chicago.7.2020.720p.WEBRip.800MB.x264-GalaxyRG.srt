1
00:00:59,734 --> 00:01:03,067
I have today ordered
to Vietnam the Airmobile Division

2
00:01:03,817 --> 00:01:07,192
and certain other forces
which will raise our fighting strength

3
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:13,650
from 75,000 to 125,000 men
almost immediately.

4
00:01:13,734 --> 00:01:17,442
This will make it necessary
to increase our active fighting forces

5
00:01:17,525 --> 00:01:23,192
by raising the monthly draft call
from 17,000 to 35,000.

6
00:01:24,984 --> 00:01:27,567
December 30th.

7
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:30,400
All those whose birthday
falls on December 30th.

8
00:01:30,484 --> 00:01:33,150
President Johnson announced
new monthlyÂ draft totals

9
00:01:33,234 --> 00:01:34,734
increasing to 35,000 per month.

10
00:01:34,817 --> 00:01:36,751
- 43,000 per month...
- 51,000...

11
00:01:36,775 --> 00:01:42,067
382,386 men between the ages
of 18 and 24 have been called to duty.

12
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,984
Now it should be
incandescently clear

13
00:01:45,067 --> 00:01:50,234
that no one who has any concern for
the integrity and life of America today

14
00:01:50,317 --> 00:01:52,525
can ignore the present war.

15
00:01:52,609 --> 00:01:55,734
If America's soul
becomes totally poisoned,

16
00:01:55,817 --> 00:01:59,442
part of the autopsy must read, "Vietnam."

17
00:02:00,442 --> 00:02:02,817
What we need
in the United States is not hatred,

18
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,442
but is love and wisdom.

19
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:08,734
So I ask you tonight to return home,

20
00:02:08,817 --> 00:02:12,567
to say a prayer for the family
of Martin Luther King.

21
00:02:17,067 --> 00:02:18,650
August 24th.

22
00:02:18,734 --> 00:02:20,414
All those whose birthday falls...

23
00:02:20,484 --> 00:02:22,876
Another 30,000 troops
have been deployed to the region.

24
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,900
This, after the US saw its greatest
increase in monthly casualties.

25
00:02:25,984 --> 00:02:28,609
What we saw were population centers.

26
00:02:28,692 --> 00:02:30,942
Schoolhouses, pagodas, women and children.

27
00:02:32,275 --> 00:02:34,859
And that's American napalm.

28
00:02:34,942 --> 00:02:38,275
Women and children were burned alive. Tom?

29
00:02:39,734 --> 00:02:41,484
The Democratic Party

30
00:02:41,567 --> 00:02:45,317
is gonna end up nominating Hubert Humphrey
next month in Chicago.

31
00:02:46,317 --> 00:02:49,650
Now, when it comes to the war
and social justice,

32
00:02:50,317 --> 00:02:52,400
there is simply not enough of a difference

33
00:02:52,484 --> 00:02:54,900
between Humphrey and Nixon
to make a difference.

34
00:02:54,984 --> 00:02:56,817
And so, we're going to Chicago.

35
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,900
Young people, by busloads,
will go to Chicago

36
00:02:59,984 --> 00:03:03,317
to show our solidarity and our disgust.

37
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,900
But most importantly...

38
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:07,775
To get laid by someone you just met.

39
00:03:07,859 --> 00:03:11,442
536,000 of us sent to a country

40
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:14,942
none of these bumper-sticker patriots
in Washington could find on a map

41
00:03:15,025 --> 00:03:16,442
with a motherfuckin' map!

42
00:03:18,234 --> 00:03:19,859
We're goin' to Chicago.

43
00:03:19,942 --> 00:03:23,400
Anyone who stays in the park,
sings Woody Guthrie, they'll be fine.

44
00:03:24,484 --> 00:03:27,817
But the cops are gonna be a half-inch
from losin' their fuckin' minds,

45
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,150
'cause Daley's gonna wind 'em up
to make sure of it.

46
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,775
We're goin' to Chicago peacefully.
We're goin' peacefully.

47
00:03:33,859 --> 00:03:36,150
But if we're met there with violence,

48
00:03:36,234 --> 00:03:39,567
you better believe that we're gonna
meet that violence with...

49
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:43,067
Nonviolence. Always nonviolence,
and that's without exception.

50
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:46,525
- What if the police hit you?
- Why would the police hit me?

51
00:03:46,609 --> 00:03:47,817
- What if they do?
- I'll duck.

52
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,859
David, he watches the news.

53
00:03:49,942 --> 00:03:51,234
I've organized 100 protests.

54
00:03:51,317 --> 00:03:55,109
This one will be no different
in that it almost certainly won't work.

55
00:03:55,192 --> 00:03:56,275
The police are--

56
00:03:56,359 --> 00:03:59,150
I'm not worried about them.
I'm worried about Hoffman and Rubin.

57
00:03:59,234 --> 00:04:01,567
It's the Democratic
National Convention, honey.

58
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:04,067
Every camera in America
is gonna be pointed at it,

59
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:07,359
and Daley is not gonna let his city
turn into a theater of war.

60
00:04:07,442 --> 00:04:10,109
Hoffman and Rubin
are geniuses in their own special way.

61
00:04:10,192 --> 00:04:12,400
- Oh, dear God.
- He's got a Boy Scout meeting at 7:00.

62
00:04:13,317 --> 00:04:14,775
Dad, if the police--

63
00:04:14,859 --> 00:04:16,150
If the police try to arrest me,

64
00:04:16,234 --> 00:04:19,442
I'll do what I always do and what
I taught you to do, which is what?

65
00:04:20,609 --> 00:04:22,859
Very calmly and very politely...

66
00:04:22,942 --> 00:04:26,317
Fuck the motherfuckers up!
They leave us alone and everything's cool.

67
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,859
They tangle, disrupt, intimidate,

68
00:04:27,942 --> 00:04:29,984
play fast and loose
with the First Amendment,

69
00:04:30,067 --> 00:04:32,484
start breaking heads,
then we will not be on our way.

70
00:04:32,567 --> 00:04:34,234
You can't give this speech in Chicago.

71
00:04:34,317 --> 00:04:37,775
- Fred wants me there. Plane ticket.
- Let Fred give the speech.

72
00:04:37,859 --> 00:04:40,067
Between Hayden and Hoffman,
there could be 5,000 people.

73
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,609
Be nice to talk to 5,000 people.

74
00:04:41,692 --> 00:04:43,484
Not while you're in trouble
in Connecticut.

75
00:04:43,567 --> 00:04:45,734
I'm the head
of the Black Panthers, Sondra.

76
00:04:45,817 --> 00:04:47,734
When won't I be in trouble? Travel bag.

77
00:04:47,817 --> 00:04:50,859
You'll be in a lot more of it
if you stand up and say, "Fry the pigs."

78
00:04:50,942 --> 00:04:52,734
If they attack.
Takin' it out of context.

79
00:04:52,817 --> 00:04:56,150
So will every white person in America.
Cops won't give a shit about context.

80
00:04:56,234 --> 00:04:57,775
You don't have protection in Chicago.

81
00:04:57,859 --> 00:04:59,400
There's no place to be but in it.

82
00:04:59,484 --> 00:05:01,400
- But "fry the pigs"?
- If they attack--

83
00:05:01,484 --> 00:05:02,942
- Dr. King--
- Is dead.

84
00:05:03,025 --> 00:05:05,817
He has a dream?
Now he has a fuckin' bullet in his head.

85
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,942
Martin's dead, Malcolm's dead,
Medgar's dead,

86
00:05:08,025 --> 00:05:09,775
Bobby's dead, Jesus is dead.

87
00:05:09,859 --> 00:05:12,317
They tried it peacefully,
we gonna try something else.

88
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,192
Sondra, I'll be there for four hours.
That's it.

89
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:17,567
Snack.

90
00:05:21,484 --> 00:05:22,900
You'll at least take one of these?

91
00:05:22,984 --> 00:05:26,025
If I knew how to use that,
I wouldn't need to be making speeches.

92
00:05:30,067 --> 00:05:34,525
It's named after the Russian commissar
Vyacheslav Mikhailovich Molotov.

93
00:05:34,609 --> 00:05:36,025
You start with a glass bottle.

94
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,067
You fill it up halfway
with gasoline and motor oil...

95
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:47,484
You pack some Styrofoam,
and now your cherry bomb.

96
00:05:49,192 --> 00:05:50,692
Some chewing gum around the top...

97
00:05:54,692 --> 00:05:55,942
...and a fuse.

98
00:05:56,025 --> 00:05:57,025
Now!

99
00:06:00,442 --> 00:06:04,067
The 35th National Democratic
Convention is set to begin next week

100
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:07,609
with repeated assurances
from Chicago Mayor, Richard J. Daley.

101
00:06:07,692 --> 00:06:11,067
- Will it be a good convention, Mr. Mayor?
- The best ever held.

102
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,900
- Is that Jerry?
- Yeah.

103
00:06:12,984 --> 00:06:15,900
Tell him to tell Abbie
we're going to Chicago to end the war

104
00:06:15,984 --> 00:06:17,442
and not to fuck around.

105
00:06:17,525 --> 00:06:20,400
Tom says to tell Abbie
that we're going to Chicago to end the war

106
00:06:20,484 --> 00:06:22,025
and not to fuck around.

107
00:06:22,567 --> 00:06:26,317
Hayden says we're goin' to Chicago
to end the war and not to fuck around.

108
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,275
Tell Hayden I went to Brandeis
and I can do both.

109
00:06:29,359 --> 00:06:33,234
We're going to show that we,
as a generation, are serious people.

110
00:06:33,317 --> 00:06:37,817
People say, "Abbie, are you concerned
about an overreaction from the cops?"

111
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:41,025
I issued a police order
to shoot to kill any arsonists.

112
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,567
We're not concerned about it.

113
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:45,942
Four units of the Illinois
National Guard, totaling 5,000 troops,

114
00:06:46,025 --> 00:06:47,442
have been sent to Chicago.

115
00:06:47,525 --> 00:06:48,692
We're countin' on it!

116
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:52,192
We wanna underscore again
that we're coming to Chicago peacefully,

117
00:06:52,275 --> 00:06:54,984
but whether we're given permits
or not, we're coming.

118
00:06:55,067 --> 00:06:58,609
An additional 10,000 Chicago
police officers, including riot squads...

119
00:06:58,692 --> 00:07:01,442
We're not going to storm the convention
with tanks or mace,

120
00:07:01,525 --> 00:07:04,609
but we are going to storm the hearts
and minds of the American people.

121
00:07:04,692 --> 00:07:06,942
These people are revolutionaries

122
00:07:07,025 --> 00:07:10,359
bent on the destruction of the government
of the United States of America.

123
00:07:10,442 --> 00:07:15,650
The Democratic Convention
is about to begin in a police state.

124
00:07:15,734 --> 00:07:18,442
There just doesn't seem to be
any other way to say it.

125
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,900
You've arrived at a moment in history.

126
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,192
- Pardon?
- They're changing the picture.

127
00:07:53,692 --> 00:07:55,317
- Tom.
- Howard.

128
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,859
- Flew in all right?
- Sure.

129
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,942
- Richard Schultz?
- Yes, sir.

130
00:07:59,025 --> 00:08:01,525
Howard Ackerman, Special Advisor
to the Attorney General.

131
00:08:01,609 --> 00:08:03,960
- Pleased to meet you.
- Anyone tell you what this is about?

132
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:07,692
No, sir. Just to meet Mr. Foran at O'Hare
this morning, we'd fly to Washington.

133
00:08:07,775 --> 00:08:09,692
- We'd be meeting Mr. Mitchell.
- Good.

134
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:14,109
Finally changing that goddamn picture.
Come on in.

135
00:08:19,525 --> 00:08:21,484
As a matter of courtesy and tradition,

136
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:25,109
when we elect a new president,
the outgoing cabinet members resign

137
00:08:25,192 --> 00:08:28,275
to spare the new president
the unpleasantness of firing 'em.

138
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,025
Richard, do you know when President Nixon

139
00:08:31,109 --> 00:08:33,984
received Ramsey Clark's
formal letter of resignation?

140
00:08:34,525 --> 00:08:37,109
- No, sir.
- About an hour before my confirmation.

141
00:08:37,192 --> 00:08:38,775
That was to embarrass me.

142
00:08:38,859 --> 00:08:42,234
I don't know, I think it was
more embarrassing for Ramsey Clark.

143
00:08:42,317 --> 00:08:43,234
I'm John Mitchell.

144
00:08:43,317 --> 00:08:45,942
Thomas Foran, Mr. Attorney General,
and this is Richard Schultz.

145
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:49,692
Richard, Chicago is more fucked up than
any ten things I've ever seen in my life.

146
00:08:49,775 --> 00:08:51,650
- Sir?
- The convention, the riots.

147
00:08:51,734 --> 00:08:53,359
- Yes, sir.
- Sit.

148
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:57,817
- Johnnie Walker okay with everybody?
- Yes, thank you.

149
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,609
- Richard?
- Nothing for me, thank you.

150
00:08:59,692 --> 00:09:02,984
We don't know how Humphrey's people
could have been that stupid.

151
00:09:03,067 --> 00:09:05,609
Allow their guy
to be nominated under armed guard.

152
00:09:06,317 --> 00:09:08,650
- Sir?
- Son, are you nervous?

153
00:09:08,734 --> 00:09:10,400
- No, sir.
- Why the fuck not?

154
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:15,192
I'm kidding. Don't believe
everything you've heard about me.

155
00:09:15,275 --> 00:09:19,567
Ramsey Clark gave me the finger
on the way out the door.

156
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:22,900
I'm asking if you think Chicago
was why Humphrey lost the election.

157
00:09:22,984 --> 00:09:25,484
No, sir.
The Republicans ran a better candidate.

158
00:09:25,567 --> 00:09:27,687
- That's for damn sure.
- Daley didn't help his party,

159
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,859
but Humphrey's people
and Daley didn't break the law,

160
00:09:29,942 --> 00:09:31,317
so that's somebody else's table.

161
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,900
As a matter of fact, we don't believe
any federal laws were broken last summer.

162
00:09:34,984 --> 00:09:37,900
Mr. Foran had our office
run a thorough investigation.

163
00:09:37,984 --> 00:09:41,442
There was trespassing, destruction
of public property, lewd behavior.

164
00:09:41,525 --> 00:09:43,484
Nothing that would rise to the level--

165
00:09:43,567 --> 00:09:46,192
You think you and your boss
are in the attorney general's office

166
00:09:46,275 --> 00:09:50,442
because I want you to seek an indictment
for violating a federal trespassing law?

167
00:09:51,317 --> 00:09:53,692
Our office wasn't aware
that the Justice Department

168
00:09:53,775 --> 00:09:55,400
wanted to seek any indictments at all.

169
00:09:55,484 --> 00:09:57,400
- We do.
- Ramsey Clark was dead set against--

170
00:09:57,484 --> 00:09:59,775
Ramsey Clark doesn't run
the Justice Department anymore,

171
00:09:59,859 --> 00:10:00,942
did you hear about that?

172
00:10:01,025 --> 00:10:03,567
- And Mr. Johnson's back home in Texas.
- Of course, sir.

173
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:06,109
One hour before
my confirmation hearing gaveled,

174
00:10:06,192 --> 00:10:08,484
that's when he resigned.
What a prick!

175
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:10,484
That's unprofessional.

176
00:10:10,567 --> 00:10:13,650
Unprofessional? It was unpatriotic.
I'll tell you what else.

177
00:10:13,734 --> 00:10:17,234
It was impolite.
There's such a thing as manners.

178
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:20,692
I want to bring back manners.
How about that? The America I grew up in.

179
00:10:21,275 --> 00:10:22,775
Will you help me, Mr. Schultz?

180
00:10:22,859 --> 00:10:26,025
'Cause I asked Mr. Foran
who was the best prosecutor in his office.

181
00:10:26,109 --> 00:10:27,859
- He said you.
- Thank you.

182
00:10:27,942 --> 00:10:30,859
Section 2101 of Title 18.

183
00:10:30,942 --> 00:10:32,900
That's the federal law that was broken.

184
00:10:32,984 --> 00:10:34,609
That's the Rap Brown Law.

185
00:10:34,692 --> 00:10:38,317
In conspiracy to cross state lines
in order to incite violence.

186
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,442
Comes with a maximum of ten years.
We want all ten.

187
00:10:41,525 --> 00:10:43,650
- For whom, sir?
- The all-star team.

188
00:10:46,317 --> 00:10:50,317
"Abbie Hoffman, Tom Hayden, Jerry Rubin,
David Dellinger, Rennie Davis,

189
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,150
Lee Weiner, John Froines...
and Bobby Seale?"

190
00:10:54,234 --> 00:10:58,234
I call 'em the school boys, and when I do,
everyone here knows who I'm talking about.

191
00:10:58,317 --> 00:11:00,150
Petulant and dangerous.

192
00:11:00,234 --> 00:11:03,817
And we watched for a decade
while these rebels without a job,

193
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,525
who never got their hands dirty
fighting the enemy,

194
00:11:06,609 --> 00:11:09,025
tell us how to prosecute a war.

195
00:11:09,567 --> 00:11:11,984
The decade's over, the grown-ups are back,

196
00:11:12,067 --> 00:11:16,734
and I deem these shitty little fairies
to be a threat to national security.

197
00:11:16,817 --> 00:11:20,359
So they're gonna spend their thirties
in a federal facility.

198
00:11:20,442 --> 00:11:22,692
- Real-time.
- You're lead prosecutor, Richard.

199
00:11:23,317 --> 00:11:25,650
You understand
why I couldn't tell you until we got here?

200
00:11:25,734 --> 00:11:26,817
Sure. Of course, sir.

201
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:31,067
Richard, you're being handed the ball.
Are you ready for this?

202
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:34,900
You pay me for my opinion.

203
00:11:35,484 --> 00:11:37,900
- What?
- I said, sir, you pay me for my opinion.

204
00:11:37,984 --> 00:11:40,567
Where'd you learn that?
In class? I pay you to win.

205
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:43,150
I'm not sure we can get
a good indictment on conspiracy.

206
00:11:43,234 --> 00:11:45,942
- Why not?
- Some of them have never met each other.

207
00:11:46,025 --> 00:11:47,275
Telephones.

208
00:11:48,525 --> 00:11:53,442
Mr. Attorney General, the Rap Brown Law
was created by Southern whites in Congress

209
00:11:53,525 --> 00:11:55,900
to limit the free speech
of Black activists.

210
00:11:55,984 --> 00:11:58,150
- Civil rights activists--
- I know why it was passed.

211
00:11:58,234 --> 00:11:59,775
Why the fuck is he teaching...

212
00:11:59,859 --> 00:12:03,025
It doesn't matter why it was passed.
It matters what it can do.

213
00:12:03,109 --> 00:12:05,900
We're not sure what it can do.
No one's ever been charged with it.

214
00:12:05,984 --> 00:12:07,400
That makes it exciting.

215
00:12:07,484 --> 00:12:10,192
It's like virgin land.
Undeveloped real estate.

216
00:12:10,734 --> 00:12:13,484
- It's a law and they broke it.
- Of course, sir.

217
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:14,817
- Is there a problem?
- No, sir.

218
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,900
Say what you want to say,
since I'm paying for your wisdom.

219
00:12:17,984 --> 00:12:19,317
Give me my money's worth.

220
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,192
Sir, there are people who will see this

221
00:12:21,275 --> 00:12:23,567
as the Justice Department
restraining free speech

222
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:26,484
and there were people
who see these men as martyrs.

223
00:12:26,567 --> 00:12:28,859
- Are any of those people in this room?
- No, sir.

224
00:12:28,942 --> 00:12:31,650
You're 33 and you're about
to be named lead prosecutor

225
00:12:31,734 --> 00:12:33,900
in the most important trial
in your lifetime

226
00:12:33,984 --> 00:12:36,859
after being handpicked
by the attorney general.

227
00:12:36,942 --> 00:12:38,775
I'm about to do that right now.

228
00:12:38,859 --> 00:12:42,942
But before I do, let me ask you,
how do you see them?

229
00:12:43,859 --> 00:12:46,150
- Personally or in terms of--
- Personally.

230
00:12:46,234 --> 00:12:48,567
I see them as vulgar, anti-establishment,

231
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:52,275
antisocial and unpragmatic,
but none of those things are indictable.

232
00:12:52,359 --> 00:12:54,817
Imagine how impressed I'll be
when you get an indictment.

233
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,442
- There's a bigger question.
- Which is?

234
00:12:57,525 --> 00:13:01,359
Who started the riots?
Was it the protesters or the police?

235
00:13:01,442 --> 00:13:04,650
- The police don't start riots.
- They'll have witnesses who say they did.

236
00:13:04,734 --> 00:13:06,859
And you'll dismantle them and win,

237
00:13:06,942 --> 00:13:10,192
because, Mr. Schultz,
that's what's expected of you.

238
00:13:12,859 --> 00:13:15,359
You didn't show
a lot of gratitude in there.

239
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:20,734
On top of everything, we're giving them
what they want: a stage and an audience.

240
00:13:21,359 --> 00:13:23,484
You think there's gonna be a big audience?

241
00:13:23,567 --> 00:13:27,109
The whole world is watching!

242
00:13:27,192 --> 00:13:28,442
Yes, sir, I do.

243
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:33,567
The whole world is watching!

244
00:13:34,609 --> 00:13:37,442
- Traitors!
- Lock up the longhairs!

245
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,525
Power to the people!

246
00:13:39,609 --> 00:13:41,067
No more war!

247
00:13:44,109 --> 00:13:47,442
The whole world is watching!

248
00:13:48,025 --> 00:13:50,567
Get out! How dare you? Get out!

249
00:13:51,567 --> 00:13:53,067
- Abbie!
- Are you all right?

250
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,275
Abbie, over here.

251
00:13:54,359 --> 00:13:57,692
- I was, until I saw that.
- Most of them are on our side.

252
00:13:57,775 --> 00:13:59,859
- We love you, Abbie!
- See?

253
00:14:01,067 --> 00:14:01,900
Watch out!

254
00:14:01,984 --> 00:14:04,734
Jesus Christ!
How did you do that?

255
00:14:05,609 --> 00:14:06,609
Experience.

256
00:14:06,692 --> 00:14:09,692
Abbie, right over here!

257
00:14:09,775 --> 00:14:11,192
Over here! Over here!

258
00:14:11,275 --> 00:14:13,150
You don't know what to do
with the egg now?

259
00:14:13,234 --> 00:14:14,234
No.

260
00:14:16,192 --> 00:14:19,734
- Mr. Kunstler, one question!
- Bill! Bill!

261
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:22,400
All right. Hang on. Quiet down.

262
00:14:22,484 --> 00:14:25,942
I want you all to meet
a new addition to the defense team.

263
00:14:26,025 --> 00:14:28,150
This is Leonard Weinglass,

264
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:31,442
one of this country's most
talented First Amendment litigators.

265
00:14:31,525 --> 00:14:33,984
- Bill, can you tell us--
- Go ahead, Sy.

266
00:14:34,067 --> 00:14:35,525
What's the status of Charles Garry?

267
00:14:35,609 --> 00:14:38,359
Charles Garry is still in the hospital.

268
00:14:38,442 --> 00:14:41,359
You should contact his office
for information.

269
00:14:41,442 --> 00:14:42,942
- One more.
- Marjorie.

270
00:14:43,025 --> 00:14:44,775
You're representing Bobby Seale today?

271
00:14:44,859 --> 00:14:48,817
Oh, no, it's very important
that it be understood that, uh,

272
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,525
for his own protection,
his own protection,

273
00:14:51,609 --> 00:14:54,525
I will not be acting as
Bobby Seale's attorney today.

274
00:14:54,609 --> 00:14:55,442
One more. Jack.

275
00:14:55,525 --> 00:14:59,275
I was told that Hayden was the one
who wanted to bring Mr. Weinglass in,

276
00:14:59,359 --> 00:15:02,025
that Hayden has concerns
about your seriousness.

277
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:04,609
- Well...
- This is William Kunstler.

278
00:15:04,692 --> 00:15:07,817
You wanna find out how serious he is,
meet him at a witness stand.

279
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:45,442
I understand why they're tryin'
to smoke Abbie, Jerry and Hayden,

280
00:15:45,525 --> 00:15:46,859
even Rennie and Dellinger,

281
00:15:46,942 --> 00:15:49,817
but I can't figure out
what the two of us are doin' here.

282
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:53,692
I feel exactly the same way, but
this is the Academy Awards of protests,

283
00:15:53,775 --> 00:15:57,025
and as far as I'm concerned,
it's an honor just to be nominated.

284
00:15:58,484 --> 00:15:59,484
What is that?

285
00:16:00,317 --> 00:16:02,025
I've been keeping a list every day.

286
00:16:02,567 --> 00:16:05,567
Americans who've been killed
since the day we were arrested.

287
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:06,650
Why?

288
00:16:07,275 --> 00:16:10,942
With the trial starting, it might get easy
to forget who this is about.

289
00:16:18,275 --> 00:16:19,650
- Fellas.
- Morning.

290
00:16:19,734 --> 00:16:20,734
Good morning.

291
00:16:26,525 --> 00:16:29,567
I just got a question
about my seriousness.

292
00:16:30,109 --> 00:16:34,609
Whatever's going on between you and Abbie,
could you keep it out of this building?

293
00:16:34,692 --> 00:16:37,692
I got a feeling this is gearing up to be...

294
00:17:01,234 --> 00:17:03,150
- Fred.
- Bill.

295
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,817
Did you have breakfast this morning?

296
00:17:08,192 --> 00:17:10,234
- What?
- Did you have breakfast?

297
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:13,234
- I did.
- Well, what'd you have?

298
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,900
What are you doin'?

299
00:17:14,942 --> 00:17:16,484
I'm talkin' to him about breakfast

300
00:17:16,567 --> 00:17:19,109
because that's all I'm allowed
to talk to him about.

301
00:17:19,192 --> 00:17:20,192
That's right.

302
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,942
- Bobby--
- We have instructions from our lawyer.

303
00:17:24,025 --> 00:17:26,692
If you need me, I'm sittin' right there.

304
00:17:26,775 --> 00:17:29,692
You just look at me
and you say, "I need you."

305
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:33,317
- We don't need you, Bill.
- You two gonna be like this?

306
00:17:34,775 --> 00:17:38,192
Your friends shouldn't sit together.
The jury's not gonna like that.

307
00:17:38,275 --> 00:17:40,067
This isn't my jury.
If they don't like it--

308
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:41,192
No, he's right.

309
00:17:44,734 --> 00:17:47,900
Spread out, okay? In pairs.

310
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:49,525
And Fred?

311
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,275
- No, they're dressed just fine.
- It's all right.

312
00:17:54,025 --> 00:17:56,609
And take your very scary hats off.

313
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:02,650
Don't mess this up.

314
00:18:04,567 --> 00:18:06,817
All right. Good pep talk.

315
00:18:10,984 --> 00:18:11,984
Hey!

316
00:18:14,984 --> 00:18:16,275
You see the crowd out there?

317
00:18:17,234 --> 00:18:18,442
I have an egg.

318
00:18:18,525 --> 00:18:20,859
- Get rid of that.
- You don't think I want to?

319
00:18:20,942 --> 00:18:23,692
It's like we're... What's his name?
We just met him.

320
00:18:23,775 --> 00:18:25,734
- Yeah.
- What is his name?

321
00:18:25,817 --> 00:18:28,317
- Who?
- The drummer. The greatest drummer ever.

322
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,234
Gene Krupa?

323
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:32,109
No. Gene Krupa? I'm talkin' about
the drummer from Cream.

324
00:18:32,192 --> 00:18:33,609
We just met him last night.

325
00:18:33,692 --> 00:18:35,609
- Ginger Baker.
- Thank you.

326
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,650
Crowd outside is so big, it's as if
we're Ginger Baker, I was trying to say.

327
00:18:39,734 --> 00:18:42,859
- Are you stoned?
- Yeah. You?

328
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:45,359
All right, sit down.

329
00:18:48,942 --> 00:18:50,400
You remember what I said.

330
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,650
Okay, and you remember
to keep us out of prison.

331
00:18:54,317 --> 00:18:56,567
There's a lot of good advice this morning.

332
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:57,692
All rise.

333
00:19:05,525 --> 00:19:10,484
Hear ye, hear ye.
September 26th, 1969, ten o'clock a.m.

334
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:13,359
All persons having business
before the United States District Court

335
00:19:13,442 --> 00:19:15,817
of Northern Illinois,
Southern District, Eastern Division,

336
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,775
draw near and ye shall be heard.

337
00:19:17,859 --> 00:19:19,859
Judge Julius Hoffman presiding.

338
00:19:19,942 --> 00:19:22,775
God save the United States of America
and this Honorable Court.

339
00:19:22,859 --> 00:19:24,067
Be seated.

340
00:19:26,275 --> 00:19:29,650
Mr. Marshal, bring in our jury.

341
00:19:41,317 --> 00:19:44,442
Let the record show
that we have been joined

342
00:19:44,525 --> 00:19:48,067
by our 12 jurors and four alternates.

343
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:50,484
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

344
00:19:51,025 --> 00:19:52,025
Good morning.

345
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:55,734
Mrs. Winter, please call the case.

346
00:19:55,817 --> 00:19:58,734
69 CR 180,

347
00:19:58,817 --> 00:20:03,359
United States of America
vs. David Dellinger,

348
00:20:03,442 --> 00:20:06,525
Rennard C. Davis, Thomas Hayden,

349
00:20:06,609 --> 00:20:09,775
Abbott Hoffman, Jerry C. Rubin,

350
00:20:09,859 --> 00:20:15,609
Lee Weiner, John R. Froines
and Bobby G. Seale for trial.

351
00:20:15,692 --> 00:20:18,025
Are the People ready
to make opening arguments?

352
00:20:18,109 --> 00:20:19,109
We are, Your Honor.

353
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:22,359
- I don't have my lawyer here.
- It's not your turn to speak.

354
00:20:22,442 --> 00:20:24,234
My trial's begun without my lawyer.

355
00:20:24,317 --> 00:20:26,817
Please sit.

356
00:20:31,859 --> 00:20:32,859
Mr. Schultz?

357
00:20:36,025 --> 00:20:38,525
Good morning.
My name is Richard Schultz.

358
00:20:38,609 --> 00:20:41,609
I'm an assistant US attorney
for the Southern District of Illinois.

359
00:20:41,692 --> 00:20:44,567
Seated at my table is my boss,
US Attorney Thomas Foran.

360
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:46,942
Or you could say, I'm seated at his table.

361
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:50,900
At the defense table
are the eight defendants

362
00:20:50,984 --> 00:20:54,442
represented by their lawyers
William Kunstler, Leonard Weinglass.

363
00:20:55,442 --> 00:20:59,692
Now, the defendants would tell you that
they represent three different groups.

364
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:02,359
- They would tell you that one group is--
- Excuse me.

365
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:03,984
Yes, sir.

366
00:21:04,067 --> 00:21:07,192
I'd like to clarify something
for the jurors.

367
00:21:07,275 --> 00:21:10,025
There are two Hoffmans in this courtroom.

368
00:21:10,109 --> 00:21:14,775
The defendant Abbie Hoffman
and myself, Judge Julius Hoffman.

369
00:21:15,734 --> 00:21:16,567
Thank you, sir.

370
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,150
I didn't want there to be
confusion on the matter.

371
00:21:19,234 --> 00:21:21,484
Man, I don't think
they're gonna mix us up.

372
00:21:23,067 --> 00:21:25,817
You will address this court
as Judge or Your Honor,

373
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,817
and you will not
address this court until...

374
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,650
You will not address this court!

375
00:21:33,275 --> 00:21:36,234
The defendants would tell you
they represent three different groups.

376
00:21:36,317 --> 00:21:38,484
And the record should reflect

377
00:21:38,567 --> 00:21:42,567
that defendant Hoffman and I
are not related.

378
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:44,067
Father, no!

379
00:21:45,567 --> 00:21:48,692
Mr. Hoffman, are you familiar
with contempt of court?

380
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:52,525
It's practically a religion for me, sir.

381
00:21:53,775 --> 00:21:55,734
- Your Honor?
- Continue.

382
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:02,484
Rennie Davis and Tom Hayden
are the leaders of the SDS,

383
00:22:02,567 --> 00:22:04,359
Students for a Democratic Society.

384
00:22:04,984 --> 00:22:07,692
Davis and Hayden
brought their people to Chicago

385
00:22:07,775 --> 00:22:10,484
for the purpose
of causing violence in the streets

386
00:22:10,567 --> 00:22:13,150
in order to disrupt
the Democratic Convention.

387
00:22:13,234 --> 00:22:16,109
You know the Youth International Party
as the Yippies.

388
00:22:16,859 --> 00:22:19,525
Their leaders are
Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin.

389
00:22:19,609 --> 00:22:22,984
Bobby Seale is the leader
of the Black Panther Party.

390
00:22:23,567 --> 00:22:27,400
Again, the defendants would tell you
that these are three distinct groups.

391
00:22:27,484 --> 00:22:29,317
- But they all--
- Excuse me.

392
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,234
Yes.

393
00:22:30,317 --> 00:22:32,442
- May I speak?
- No, sir.

394
00:22:32,525 --> 00:22:33,609
He just said my name.

395
00:22:33,692 --> 00:22:37,442
You're a defendant in this case.
You're likely to hear your name.

396
00:22:37,525 --> 00:22:41,275
I have a right to counsel,
and His Honor knows that.

397
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:45,525
Don't tell the court what it does
and does not know. Be seated.

398
00:22:48,859 --> 00:22:50,234
Mr. Schultz.

399
00:22:54,192 --> 00:22:55,609
The radical left. That's all.

400
00:22:55,692 --> 00:22:57,734
They're the radical left
in different costumes.

401
00:22:57,817 --> 00:22:59,567
These defendants had a plan,

402
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:02,484
and a plan among two or more people
is a conspiracy.

403
00:23:03,067 --> 00:23:05,692
The defendants crossed state lines
to execute their plan.

404
00:23:05,775 --> 00:23:09,317
That's why we're in federal court,
and the plan was to incite a riot,

405
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,734
and there's one thing you already know.

406
00:23:12,484 --> 00:23:13,567
They succeeded.

407
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:18,692
Excuse me. Have we identified
the other defendants for the record?

408
00:23:19,525 --> 00:23:21,192
A Mr... Wiener.

409
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:22,650
Weiner.

410
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:25,234
Mr. Froines and Mr. Dillinger.

411
00:23:25,317 --> 00:23:26,442
Dellinger, Your Honor.

412
00:23:27,192 --> 00:23:28,275
What's going on here?

413
00:23:28,359 --> 00:23:30,734
Uh, you're referring
to the defendant Dellinger.

414
00:23:30,817 --> 00:23:34,067
- Derringer.
- Um, it's Dellinger, sir.

415
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:39,275
Note the prosecution was referring
to the defendant Derringer.

416
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:41,900
- Not Dellinger.
- It is Dellinger, Your Honor.

417
00:23:41,984 --> 00:23:43,900
Can we straighten this out?

418
00:23:43,984 --> 00:23:47,817
Sure. Dillinger was a bank robber.
Derringer is a gun.

419
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,900
He's David Dellinger,
and the judge and I are not related.

420
00:23:50,984 --> 00:23:54,484
Your Honor, I'd like to caution the court
that this kind of disruption

421
00:23:54,567 --> 00:23:58,150
and display of disrespect
will be a continuing tactic for defense.

422
00:23:58,234 --> 00:24:00,484
Sir, it's not a tactic.
At the moment,

423
00:24:00,567 --> 00:24:03,734
the defendants are the only ones
on record as knowing their own names.

424
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:05,567
Be seated, Mr. Schultz...

425
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:07,817
Uh, Mr. Kunstler.

426
00:24:09,859 --> 00:24:12,275
I object to being characterized
as a member of this group.

427
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:14,692
- Who is your lawyer?
- Charles R. Garry.

428
00:24:14,775 --> 00:24:16,609
Is Mr. Garry here today?

429
00:24:16,692 --> 00:24:18,067
- No, he is not.
- Your Honor--

430
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:19,692
Are you representing Mr. Seale?

431
00:24:19,775 --> 00:24:21,525
- No, sir.
- Then, sit.

432
00:24:23,484 --> 00:24:26,067
Mr. Schultz, forgive me.

433
00:24:26,609 --> 00:24:28,775
Have you concluded your opening statement?

434
00:24:29,692 --> 00:24:30,817
Yes, Your Honor.

435
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,567
My lawyer Charles Garry
is in a hospital in Oakland

436
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:35,525
having undergone gallbladder surgery.

437
00:24:35,609 --> 00:24:36,775
Mr. Kunstler.

438
00:24:37,484 --> 00:24:39,650
You are sitting right next to the man.

439
00:24:39,734 --> 00:24:42,109
Just represent him.
It's the same case.

440
00:24:42,192 --> 00:24:45,025
The fact that there's a lawyer near Mr. Seale

441
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:47,609
does not satisfy
the requirements of due process.

442
00:24:47,692 --> 00:24:48,775
I have a right--

443
00:24:48,859 --> 00:24:53,817
A motion was made for postponement
due to Mr. Garry's medical condition.

444
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,609
I was there.
Your Honor denied that motion.

445
00:24:56,692 --> 00:24:59,775
Therefore, Mr. Seale is here
without legal representation.

446
00:24:59,859 --> 00:25:04,650
I don't care
for your general tone, Mr. Kunstler.

447
00:25:04,734 --> 00:25:07,025
I meant no disrespect to the court.

448
00:25:07,109 --> 00:25:11,567
I'm trying to be clear that I can't muddy
Mr. Seale's grounds for appeal

449
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:13,484
by appearing to speak as his lawyer.

450
00:25:13,567 --> 00:25:17,025
I don't ask you to compromise
Mr. Seale's position, sir.

451
00:25:17,109 --> 00:25:21,400
But I will not permit him
to address the jury

452
00:25:21,484 --> 00:25:23,942
when his perfectly competent lawyer
is sitting--

453
00:25:24,025 --> 00:25:26,400
For the fourth time,
he's not Bobby's lawyer.

454
00:25:28,817 --> 00:25:31,275
You're, uh... Mr. Rubin.

455
00:25:31,942 --> 00:25:33,025
Yes, sir.

456
00:25:33,109 --> 00:25:34,567
Don't ever do that again!

457
00:25:37,317 --> 00:25:39,150
Your Honor,
I'm not with these guys.

458
00:25:39,234 --> 00:25:42,234
I never met most of them
until the indictment.

459
00:25:42,317 --> 00:25:44,650
- We will have order.
- There are eight of us here.

460
00:25:44,734 --> 00:25:48,692
There are signs out there that read,
"Free the Chicago 7." I'm not with them!

461
00:25:48,775 --> 00:25:52,775
- Mr. Marshal, will you seat Mr. Seale?
- Conspiracy? I never met most of them.

462
00:25:52,859 --> 00:25:56,484
Frankly, the US attorney wanted
a Negro defendant to scare the jury.

463
00:25:56,567 --> 00:25:58,984
I was thrown in
to make the group look scarier.

464
00:25:59,067 --> 00:26:01,109
I came to Chicago.
I made a speech!

465
00:26:01,192 --> 00:26:02,942
- Mr. Seale--
- I had a chicken pot pie,

466
00:26:03,025 --> 00:26:05,359
went to the airport
and I flew back to Oakland,

467
00:26:05,442 --> 00:26:06,984
that's why they call it the Chicago...

468
00:26:07,067 --> 00:26:08,900
Get your hands off me!

469
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:12,817
Charge Mr. Seale
with one count of contempt of court.

470
00:26:38,525 --> 00:26:40,192
We have to make a decision right now,

471
00:26:40,275 --> 00:26:44,317
a decision I assumed we'd already made
four months ago when trial prep began.

472
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,650
Are we using this trial to defend
ourselves against very serious charges

473
00:26:48,734 --> 00:26:50,484
that could land us in prison
for ten years?

474
00:26:51,567 --> 00:26:54,484
Or to say a pointless "fuck you"
to the establishment?

475
00:26:54,567 --> 00:26:57,650
- Fuck you!
- That is what I was afraid...

476
00:26:58,525 --> 00:27:01,525
- Were you saying "fuck you" or answering--
- I was also confused.

477
00:27:01,609 --> 00:27:05,109
If we leave without saying anything
about why we came in the first place,

478
00:27:05,192 --> 00:27:06,275
it'll be heartbreaking.

479
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:08,692
If the jury finds us guilty,
we're not leaving at all.

480
00:27:08,775 --> 00:27:11,359
The only thing we need to say
about why we came here

481
00:27:11,442 --> 00:27:13,192
is it wasn't to incite violence.

482
00:27:13,984 --> 00:27:14,984
I'm with Jerry.

483
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:18,692
- Why?
- The trial shouldn't be about us.

484
00:27:18,775 --> 00:27:22,234
I would love it if it wasn't about us,
but it definitely is. John? Lee?

485
00:27:22,859 --> 00:27:24,609
Does anyone think our judge is crazy?

486
00:27:24,692 --> 00:27:27,150
- He isn't our problem.
- Give it time. He will be.

487
00:27:27,234 --> 00:27:31,150
I'm talking about us.
Abbie, you cannot talk back to the judge.

488
00:27:31,234 --> 00:27:34,567
- And, Jerry... Jesus!
- Did you get a haircut just for court?

489
00:27:35,984 --> 00:27:38,900
- I did.
- A haircut for the judge. That is...

490
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:41,984
I can't even. That is...

491
00:27:42,067 --> 00:27:43,734
That is so foreign to me.

492
00:27:43,817 --> 00:27:45,317
- So is soap.
- Zing.

493
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,567
Let me explain something.
It took you two less than five minutes

494
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:52,400
to make us look exactly like what Schultz
is trying to make us look like.

495
00:27:52,484 --> 00:27:54,609
I don't have a problem
with what we look like.

496
00:27:54,692 --> 00:27:57,275
Jerry likes what we look like.
Uh, John?

497
00:27:57,359 --> 00:27:58,442
- Lee?
- Yeah.

498
00:27:58,525 --> 00:28:02,109
- I feel like I'm ten pounds too heavy.
- I don't like it when we fight.

499
00:28:02,192 --> 00:28:03,984
- Rennie?
- Tom should be heard.

500
00:28:04,067 --> 00:28:05,067
And he was.

501
00:28:05,609 --> 00:28:10,109
When we walked in here, they were chanting
that the whole world is watching.

502
00:28:10,192 --> 00:28:11,900
This is it. We're on.

503
00:28:11,984 --> 00:28:16,150
This is what revolution looks like.
Real revolution. Cultural revolution.

504
00:28:16,234 --> 00:28:17,775
Why did you come here?

505
00:28:17,859 --> 00:28:19,775
I got an invitation from a grand jury.

506
00:28:19,859 --> 00:28:21,900
Last summer.
Why did you come to the convention?

507
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,400
To end the war.

508
00:28:24,484 --> 00:28:26,734
Guys, before you tether yourselves
to this man,

509
00:28:26,817 --> 00:28:30,234
just know the very last thing he wants
is for the war to end.

510
00:28:30,317 --> 00:28:35,317
I don't have time for cultural revolution.
It distracts from actual revolution.

511
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,234
All right, all right, all right.

512
00:28:37,317 --> 00:28:39,234
But you got time for a haircut.

513
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:41,234
Has everybody got everything
off their chest?

514
00:28:41,817 --> 00:28:44,400
- What in the name of hell was that?
- Evidently not.

515
00:28:44,484 --> 00:28:45,942
You spoke for Bobby.

516
00:28:46,025 --> 00:28:48,442
I made it very clear
that I'm not his lawyer.

517
00:28:48,525 --> 00:28:50,845
- I'd like to sit in on these meetings.
- You can't.

518
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,609
- I think I will anyway.
- Fred--

519
00:28:52,692 --> 00:28:54,942
Bobby's life is at stake.
You're playing to the crowd.

520
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:56,734
- Thank you.
- Shut up.

521
00:28:56,817 --> 00:29:00,525
White guys sitting in a furnished room
eating sandwiches while Bobby's in a cell.

522
00:29:00,609 --> 00:29:02,775
White guys are free on bail.
Bobby's locked up

523
00:29:02,859 --> 00:29:05,650
because he's under arrest
in Connecticut for killing a cop.

524
00:29:05,734 --> 00:29:08,609
It's not like he refused
to give up his seat on a bus.

525
00:29:08,692 --> 00:29:12,442
Convince him to let Bill and me
represent him, just for today, at least.

526
00:29:12,525 --> 00:29:13,984
- The judge is--
- Fucking nuts.

527
00:29:14,067 --> 00:29:17,275
A little hostile.
I'm sure Garry didn't anticipate that.

528
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:20,567
He's innocent in Connecticut.

529
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:22,525
- All right.
- He's never killed anyone.

530
00:29:22,609 --> 00:29:24,984
- It's important that you all know that.
- Okay.

531
00:29:25,067 --> 00:29:28,150
All right, you gotta try to convince him.

532
00:29:30,025 --> 00:29:31,025
I can't.

533
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,567
- Well, try.
- I have!

534
00:29:34,234 --> 00:29:35,692
Well, keep trying, all right?

535
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:38,150
We're back.

536
00:29:38,817 --> 00:29:39,817
Let's go.

537
00:29:40,359 --> 00:29:43,650
Jerry, Abbie,
unless you're asked a direct question,

538
00:29:43,734 --> 00:29:46,192
I want you
to keep your mouths shut in that room.

539
00:29:46,275 --> 00:29:48,275
- This is a political trial.
- What?

540
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:51,859
This is a political trial
that was already decided for us.

541
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,067
Ignoring that reality is just weird to me.

542
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:58,359
There are civil trials
and there are criminal trials.

543
00:29:58,442 --> 00:30:00,650
There's no such thing
as a political trial.

544
00:30:00,734 --> 00:30:01,817
Okay.

545
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,275
Abbie's smarter than you think he is.

546
00:30:22,275 --> 00:30:24,317
Cows are smarter than I think he is.

547
00:30:26,275 --> 00:30:29,025
- S-T-A-H-L.
- What is your occupation?

548
00:30:29,109 --> 00:30:30,859
I am the mayor's administrative officer.

549
00:30:30,942 --> 00:30:36,775
Calling your attention to March 26, 1968.
Did you have a meeting on that day?

550
00:30:36,859 --> 00:30:38,484
- Yes.
- Uh, with whom?

551
00:30:38,567 --> 00:30:41,859
- Mr. Hoffman and Mr. Rubin, is it?
- Abbie and Jerry is fine.

552
00:30:41,942 --> 00:30:43,359
What was said at that meeting?

553
00:30:43,442 --> 00:30:47,317
I was told the Youth International Party
would be holding a festival of life

554
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,734
during the Democratic National Convention.

555
00:30:49,817 --> 00:30:52,150
There would be thousands
of young people attending

556
00:30:52,234 --> 00:30:54,275
and there'd be rock bands
playing in the park.

557
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:55,650
Music will be performed.

558
00:30:55,734 --> 00:30:57,650
- Rock music?
- I would think.

559
00:30:57,734 --> 00:31:00,317
They also said
there would be public fornication.

560
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,567
Say that again, sir?

561
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:03,109
Public fornication.

562
00:31:03,192 --> 00:31:05,692
You're asking
for a Parks permit for public--

563
00:31:05,775 --> 00:31:07,025
- Yeah.
- And rock music.

564
00:31:07,109 --> 00:31:08,025
No, of course not.

565
00:31:08,109 --> 00:31:09,234
What if it was R&B?

566
00:31:09,317 --> 00:31:12,109
- Did you issue the permits?
- No, I did not.

567
00:31:12,692 --> 00:31:17,567
And what, if anything, did Abbie Hoffman
say when you denied their request?

568
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:19,942
Mr. Stahl, you need
to understand something.

569
00:31:20,025 --> 00:31:24,609
There's gonna be a festival of life
in Grant Park held during the convention.

570
00:31:24,692 --> 00:31:28,442
Bands will play rock music.
There will be public fornication.

571
00:31:28,525 --> 00:31:31,275
Likely some of it with the wives
and mistresses of delegates.

572
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:35,150
Psychedelic, long-haired leftists
will consort with dope users.

573
00:31:35,734 --> 00:31:38,359
And we'll insist that
the next president of the US

574
00:31:38,442 --> 00:31:40,609
stops sending our friends
to be slaughtered.

575
00:31:40,692 --> 00:31:43,109
This will happen
whether you give us the permit or not.

576
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:45,775
Hotels will be filled with delegates.
Where will people sleep?

577
00:31:45,859 --> 00:31:48,525
Some will sleep in tents,
others will live frivolously.

578
00:31:48,609 --> 00:31:50,567
- How many people are coming?
- A lot.

579
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:53,942
What's a lot? A thousand? Two thousand?

580
00:31:54,025 --> 00:31:55,025
Ten thousand.

581
00:31:55,109 --> 00:31:57,234
- Jesus Christ.
- Right?

582
00:31:58,025 --> 00:32:01,150
Did Abbie Hoffman add anything
at the end of the meeting?

583
00:32:01,234 --> 00:32:02,234
Yes.

584
00:32:02,275 --> 00:32:04,067
- What did he say?
- He said...

585
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:06,984
Or you give me 100 grand
and I could call the whole thing off.

586
00:32:07,067 --> 00:32:08,109
Thank you.

587
00:32:09,609 --> 00:32:11,109
Mr. Fineglass.

588
00:32:11,192 --> 00:32:12,984
Uh, Weinglass, sir.

589
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:18,484
Mr. Stahl, the meeting you just described
with Mr. Hoffman and Mr. Rubin,

590
00:32:18,567 --> 00:32:21,734
was that the only meeting you had
with any of the defendants?

591
00:32:21,817 --> 00:32:22,817
No.

592
00:32:22,859 --> 00:32:26,525
On August 2nd, you had a meeting
with Tom Hayden and Rennie Davis.

593
00:32:26,609 --> 00:32:29,109
- Tom Hayden.
- Rennie Davis.

594
00:32:29,192 --> 00:32:31,942
On August 12th,
you had a meeting with David Dellinger.

595
00:32:32,484 --> 00:32:34,400
I'll tell you the same thing
I told the others.

596
00:32:34,484 --> 00:32:37,025
There were two more meetings
with Tom and Rennie

597
00:32:37,109 --> 00:32:39,317
on the 10th and 12th of August,

598
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:43,025
and one more meeting
with David Dellinger on the 26th.

599
00:32:43,109 --> 00:32:44,275
I can't be sure of the dates.

600
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:47,609
Well, I can be sure.
They're recorded in the log at City Hall.

601
00:32:47,692 --> 00:32:48,692
Okay...

602
00:32:48,734 --> 00:32:52,817
And in each of the meetings,
a request was made for a permit

603
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:55,692
to demonstrate in Grant Park
during the convention.

604
00:32:55,775 --> 00:32:58,942
Mr. Stahl, we intend a peaceful demonstration.

605
00:32:59,025 --> 00:33:02,025
We're not interested in violence
or disturbing the delegates.

606
00:33:02,109 --> 00:33:05,942
And in each of the meetings,
the request for permits was denied.

607
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:08,900
Listen, I'll tell you the same thing
I told Mr. Hoffman

608
00:33:08,984 --> 00:33:10,775
and Mr. Rubin and Mr. Dellinger.

609
00:33:10,859 --> 00:33:13,067
No demonstrations
within sight of the Hilton.

610
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:16,025
We have to demonstrate there.
That's where the convention is.

611
00:33:16,109 --> 00:33:18,734
There will be no demonstrations
within sight of the Hilton.

612
00:33:18,817 --> 00:33:21,067
Okay.
But the thing is, there will be.

613
00:33:21,984 --> 00:33:24,275
- Are you threatening me, Mr. Hayden?
- No.

614
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:26,817
We're not threatening you.
We're cautioning you.

615
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,734
Thousands of people are coming to Chicago.

616
00:33:28,817 --> 00:33:30,817
If they're not given
a place to demonstrate,

617
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,817
they'll demonstrate wherever they stand.

618
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:35,025
So it's reckless, irresponsible,

619
00:33:35,109 --> 00:33:38,150
and foolishly dangerous of the city
not to have a contingency plan.

620
00:33:38,234 --> 00:33:40,650
We're gonna need
police security, first aid...

621
00:33:40,734 --> 00:33:42,442
- Traffic control.
- Water, sanitation.

622
00:33:42,525 --> 00:33:47,109
So, five times,
you were asked for a permit.

623
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:50,109
Five times,
you were advised of the dangers

624
00:33:50,192 --> 00:33:52,650
of not providing
a location to demonstrate--

625
00:33:52,734 --> 00:33:55,025
I don't take my instructions
from the defendants.

626
00:33:55,109 --> 00:33:56,469
- No, you don't.
- I don't.

627
00:33:56,525 --> 00:33:58,067
You take them from Mayor Daley.

628
00:33:59,484 --> 00:34:02,109
You're appointed by the mayor
and you serve at his pleasure?

629
00:34:02,192 --> 00:34:03,025
Yes.

630
00:34:03,109 --> 00:34:06,234
And you're subject to removal
in the same manner by the mayor?

631
00:34:06,817 --> 00:34:08,817
- Yes.
- Thank you.

632
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:11,775
Further cross-examination, Mr. Kunstler.

633
00:34:11,859 --> 00:34:14,400
Yes, sir. Mr. Stahl. When Abbie--

634
00:34:14,484 --> 00:34:15,650
Excuse me.

635
00:34:15,734 --> 00:34:20,359
Mr. Seale, would you identify
the man sitting behind you?

636
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:22,859
- No, sir.
- No?

637
00:34:22,942 --> 00:34:24,109
- That's right.
- Why not?

638
00:34:24,192 --> 00:34:25,859
He's not on trial here.

639
00:34:25,942 --> 00:34:31,109
Mr. Seale, identify the man behind you.

640
00:34:35,192 --> 00:34:36,275
His name is Fred Hampton.

641
00:34:36,359 --> 00:34:37,859
Let the record indicate

642
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:42,025
that Mr. Hampton is head of the Chicago
chapter of the Black Panther Party.

643
00:34:42,109 --> 00:34:46,275
Your Honor, Mr. Hampton isn't at the bar.
Why is the record identifying him at all?

644
00:34:46,359 --> 00:34:49,609
Mr. Hampton is clearly
giving Mr. Seale legal advice.

645
00:34:49,692 --> 00:34:51,942
My lawyer is Charles Garry.

646
00:34:52,025 --> 00:34:53,567
Excuse me, sir, but for all you know,

647
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:56,609
Mr. Hampton is giving Mr. Seale
the score of the White Sox game.

648
00:34:56,692 --> 00:34:58,984
- I will assume that he is not.
- Why?

649
00:34:59,067 --> 00:35:02,942
Because that's what happens
when you don't have a lawyer.

650
00:35:03,025 --> 00:35:06,400
The court assumes
that you are being represented

651
00:35:06,484 --> 00:35:09,484
by the Black Panther sitting behind you.

652
00:35:12,775 --> 00:35:13,775
Continue.

653
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:19,317
Mr. Stahl, when Abbie offered
to call the whole thing off for $100,000,

654
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,692
did you think that he was serious
or did you think he was making a joke?

655
00:35:23,775 --> 00:35:26,609
I had no reason
not to think he was serious.

656
00:35:26,692 --> 00:35:29,317
- Really? Do you know what extortion is?
- Yes.

657
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,984
- Do you know it's a felony?
- Yes.

658
00:35:31,067 --> 00:35:33,109
Okay. So, when you called the FBI

659
00:35:33,192 --> 00:35:36,900
and told 'em about Mr. Hoffman's attempt
to extort a government employee,

660
00:35:36,984 --> 00:35:38,942
- what'd they say?
- I didn't call the FBI.

661
00:35:39,025 --> 00:35:42,109
Sorry. When you called the US attorney
and reported attempted extortion,

662
00:35:42,192 --> 00:35:44,525
- what'd their office say?
- I didn't call the US att--

663
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:47,025
- Cooke County DA. Did you call them?
- No, sir.

664
00:35:47,109 --> 00:35:48,984
- The chief of police?
- Mr. Kunstler--

665
00:35:49,067 --> 00:35:51,609
The police officer posted
outside the mayor's office?

666
00:35:51,692 --> 00:35:55,067
How about the mayor?
Mr. Stahl, I'm gonna ask you again.

667
00:35:55,650 --> 00:36:01,442
When Abbie Hoffman asked
for $100,000 to call the whole thing off,

668
00:36:01,525 --> 00:36:05,984
did you think that he was serious
or did you know that he was making a joke?

669
00:36:06,067 --> 00:36:08,942
I had no reason
not to believe he was serious.

670
00:36:09,025 --> 00:36:12,317
Then, along with extortion,
did you know that perjury is a crime?

671
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,692
- Objection.
- Sustained, and strike it.

672
00:36:14,775 --> 00:36:15,692
In fact,

673
00:36:15,775 --> 00:36:19,859
strike the entirety of Mr. Stahl's
testimony under cross-examination,

674
00:36:19,942 --> 00:36:22,734
and the jury is instructed
to disregard it.

675
00:36:22,817 --> 00:36:25,775
You're gonna strike
the entire cross-examination?

676
00:36:25,859 --> 00:36:28,650
I gave you
and co-counsel Fineglass ample--

677
00:36:28,734 --> 00:36:30,650
Co-counsel's name is Weinglass.

678
00:36:30,734 --> 00:36:34,109
Mr. Stahl's testimony
under cross-examination is entirely--

679
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,817
You are interrupting
the court again, Mr. Kunstler.

680
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,734
Move to reinstate testimony.

681
00:36:38,817 --> 00:36:40,025
Overruled.

682
00:36:45,192 --> 00:36:47,150
- Overruled.
- Exception.

683
00:36:47,234 --> 00:36:49,900
Noted.
Are there any further questions?

684
00:36:50,525 --> 00:36:53,692
Yes. So, Mr. Stahl,
in any of these meetings,

685
00:36:53,775 --> 00:36:57,359
did any of the defendants say
that if you didn't grant them permits,

686
00:36:57,442 --> 00:36:59,942
that they would do
violent acts to the city?

687
00:37:00,025 --> 00:37:05,484
Yes, they said the Parks permit should be
issued in order to minimize destruction.

688
00:37:05,567 --> 00:37:08,317
Did they indicate from whom
this destruction would come?

689
00:37:09,025 --> 00:37:12,025
The destruction did not come
from the Chicago Police Department,

690
00:37:12,109 --> 00:37:13,859
if that's what you're suggesting.

691
00:37:15,192 --> 00:37:16,400
No further questions.

692
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:19,734
I'd like to cross-examine
the witness, Your Honor.

693
00:37:19,817 --> 00:37:21,567
- You may not.
- Have you met me?

694
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:22,817
Sit, Mr. Seale.

695
00:37:28,775 --> 00:37:30,484
Are you guilty of conspiracy?

696
00:37:30,567 --> 00:37:32,609
We believe that we are innocent.

697
00:37:32,692 --> 00:37:36,400
The people who are guilty of conspiracy
are the fuckers who put us on trial.

698
00:37:36,484 --> 00:37:40,025
They are responsible for the bloodshed
that flowed in the streets of Chicago.

699
00:37:40,109 --> 00:37:42,525
Why won't Bobby Seale
let anyone represent him?

700
00:37:42,609 --> 00:37:44,984
You've posed that question
in the form of a lie.

701
00:37:53,484 --> 00:37:55,400
Conspiracy Office.
Can you hold on?

702
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,942
Conspiracy Office.
Can you hold on?

703
00:38:05,775 --> 00:38:07,734
Conspiracy Office.
Can you hold on?

704
00:38:07,817 --> 00:38:11,317
Maybe you don't want to call it the,
uh, Conspiracy Office.

705
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,400
They understand irony
and appreciate the humor.

706
00:38:13,484 --> 00:38:16,067
- I wouldn't count on it.
- Most people are smart, Bill.

707
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:19,567
If you believe that, you'll get your
heart broken every day of your life.

708
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:23,067
Hang on. Hi, how can I help you?

709
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:23,984
Messages?

710
00:38:24,067 --> 00:38:27,317
We sure do take contributions.
We've got high-priced lawyers.

711
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,109
High-priced lawyers are working for free.

712
00:38:29,192 --> 00:38:31,192
- It's the support staff.
- We can't take grass.

713
00:38:31,275 --> 00:38:32,442
- Hey!
- Yeah.

714
00:38:32,525 --> 00:38:34,692
- Abbie says we'll take the weed.
- Messages?

715
00:38:34,775 --> 00:38:37,067
Let me give you our mailing address.

716
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,942
We are in Hyde Park,

717
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:43,692
28 East Jackson Street,
Chicago, Illinois. 60604...

718
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:48,150
I don't want you guys
holding any more press conferences.

719
00:38:48,234 --> 00:38:51,942
If you're gonna get between Abbie
and a camera, I'd wear pads and a helmet.

720
00:38:52,025 --> 00:38:54,525
We had a good day, Len.
Tell him we had a good day.

721
00:38:54,609 --> 00:38:55,442
Six and eleven.

722
00:38:55,525 --> 00:38:56,734
What does that mean?

723
00:38:56,817 --> 00:39:00,067
- Jurors six and eleven. They're with us.
- How do you know?

724
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:03,817
Six made sure I saw a copy
of a James Baldwin novel under her arm,

725
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:06,359
and eleven's been nodding
during the Stahl cross.

726
00:39:06,442 --> 00:39:07,692
Falling asleep?

727
00:39:07,775 --> 00:39:09,567
Nodding. Agreeing.

728
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:11,775
No more press conferences.

729
00:39:13,859 --> 00:39:16,067
You posed that question
in the form of a lie.

730
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:19,525
Bobby Seale's lawyer is Charles Garry.
He's in the hospital right now.

731
00:39:19,609 --> 00:39:22,275
A motion was made for postponement
and it was denied.

732
00:39:22,359 --> 00:39:24,734
Would you have taken
$100,000 to call it off?

733
00:39:24,817 --> 00:39:27,900
Yeah, sure.
I would have taken $100,000.

734
00:39:27,984 --> 00:39:29,525
As for calling it off...

735
00:39:29,609 --> 00:39:31,890
How much is it worth to you?
What's your price?

736
00:39:31,942 --> 00:39:33,359
To call off the revolution?

737
00:39:35,317 --> 00:39:36,650
What's your price?

738
00:39:38,567 --> 00:39:39,567
My life.

739
00:40:15,234 --> 00:40:16,942
Any idea what's going on?

740
00:40:18,442 --> 00:40:21,317
It's been years since I've had
any idea what was going on.

741
00:40:30,692 --> 00:40:32,817
I'm going to adjourn the court for the day

742
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:35,567
and see counsel
in my chambers in 15 minutes.

743
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:36,900
All rise.

744
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,692
Gentlemen, it's been
brought to my attention

745
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,817
that two jurors received threatening notes

746
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:49,859
from a member or members
of the Black Panther Party.

747
00:40:49,942 --> 00:40:50,942
Which two jurors?

748
00:40:50,984 --> 00:40:53,400
Juror number six and juror number eleven.

749
00:40:54,692 --> 00:40:57,734
These were slipped into the mail
at the homes of their parents.

750
00:41:00,275 --> 00:41:01,525
Bring in juror six.

751
00:41:02,775 --> 00:41:03,775
Six and eleven?

752
00:41:05,275 --> 00:41:07,317
- Yes.
- Judge, I wonder if we could draw--

753
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,900
Juror number six, how are you?

754
00:41:09,692 --> 00:41:10,692
I'm fine.

755
00:41:10,775 --> 00:41:12,359
- Before we talk--
- Please.

756
00:41:12,442 --> 00:41:15,192
Your parents received this note
this morning in their mail.

757
00:41:15,275 --> 00:41:17,692
They called the police,
as they should have done.

758
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:20,275
I'd like you to take the note
and read it out loud.

759
00:41:20,984 --> 00:41:21,817
My parents?

760
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,192
- Your Honor, before she--
- Please read the note.

761
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:28,400
"We're watching you."

762
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:31,025
And you see who signed it?

763
00:41:32,192 --> 00:41:34,275
"The Panthers."

764
00:41:34,359 --> 00:41:37,109
You understand that to mean
the Black Panthers, don't you?

765
00:41:38,067 --> 00:41:41,234
You understand defendant Bobby Seale
is the head of the Black Panthers.

766
00:41:41,317 --> 00:41:44,234
- Judge, you can't--
- He's chairman of the Black Panther Party.

767
00:41:44,317 --> 00:41:48,484
Do you still feel that you can render
a fair and impartial verdict?

768
00:41:57,317 --> 00:42:00,567
Juror number six,
your family has been threatened

769
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:02,067
and so have you...

770
00:42:02,984 --> 00:42:06,817
by members of an organization
that is led by one of the defendants.

771
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,734
Judge, for the love of Christ, she...

772
00:42:12,442 --> 00:42:15,025
- I apologize, Your Honor.
- I would think so.

773
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:19,067
Do you still feel you can render
a fair and impartial verdict?

774
00:42:22,484 --> 00:42:23,525
No, sir.

775
00:42:24,234 --> 00:42:27,192
You're dismissed from this jury.
Thank you for your service.

776
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:29,734
Please bring in juror number eleven.

777
00:42:29,817 --> 00:42:32,192
- I'm sorry.
- Keep reading James Baldwin.

778
00:42:40,067 --> 00:42:42,984
Bill, I thought the Panthers
were smarter than that.

779
00:42:43,067 --> 00:42:44,234
- They are.
- Well--

780
00:42:44,317 --> 00:42:47,192
The Panthers don't write letters
any more than the Mob does.

781
00:42:47,275 --> 00:42:49,942
The moment I find out
that it was your office that did,

782
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:53,609
you'll see the criminal justice system
up closer than you ever wanted to.

783
00:43:07,109 --> 00:43:09,942
- Who are the alternates?
- We're gonna make this public.

784
00:43:10,025 --> 00:43:11,525
- Help yourself.
- Who are they?

785
00:43:11,609 --> 00:43:14,442
Somebody other than the FBI
has to investigate that letter.

786
00:43:14,525 --> 00:43:16,650
Who'd you have in mind?
Jefferson Airplane?

787
00:43:17,234 --> 00:43:19,234
- The FBI investigates.
- This is bullshit.

788
00:43:19,317 --> 00:43:20,525
Who are the alternates?

789
00:43:20,609 --> 00:43:22,329
- Fucking bullshit.
- Clean up the language.

790
00:43:22,359 --> 00:43:25,150
Kay Richards.
42-year-old dental hygienist.

791
00:43:25,234 --> 00:43:26,442
That doesn't sound bad.

792
00:43:26,525 --> 00:43:30,567
We think she's dating a guy named
Tom Banachek, who works for Daley.

793
00:43:33,192 --> 00:43:35,942
- We were out of peremptory challenges.
- How did this happen?

794
00:43:36,025 --> 00:43:38,900
It's either her or that Korean War vet

795
00:43:38,984 --> 00:43:41,650
who kicked his son out of the house
for protesting the Vietnam.

796
00:43:41,734 --> 00:43:43,609
You don't have to be Clarence Darrow...

797
00:43:43,692 --> 00:43:47,650
Did they manipulate the jury pool?
How come there's nobody who looks like me?

798
00:43:47,734 --> 00:43:52,067
All right, raise your hands if any of you
have ever shown up for jury duty.

799
00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:54,859
No? Then shut the fuck up.

800
00:43:54,942 --> 00:43:56,317
- Bill...
- Yeah?

801
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,400
What?

802
00:43:58,650 --> 00:43:59,900
He's sequestering the jury.

803
00:44:00,525 --> 00:44:01,692
Of course he is.

804
00:44:04,775 --> 00:44:07,192
No such thing as a political trial.

805
00:44:07,275 --> 00:44:08,275
Good to know.

806
00:44:10,609 --> 00:44:11,692
I...

807
00:44:11,775 --> 00:44:16,817
I want an expert in geriatric psychiatry
sitting in the gallery for a few days.

808
00:44:17,734 --> 00:44:21,609
I want a medical evaluation
of this... this judge.

809
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:32,275
The sequester's probably a reaction
to Abbie doing stand-up on weekends.

810
00:44:32,359 --> 00:44:33,567
It's not stand-up.

811
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:36,775
You're in a college auditorium
in a spotlight telling jokes.

812
00:44:36,859 --> 00:44:38,484
That's a little reductive.

813
00:44:39,692 --> 00:44:40,817
Names?

814
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:43,067
Yeah. From yesterday.

815
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:48,942
You hungry?

816
00:44:51,109 --> 00:44:53,275
If I hadn't asked you
to help me with Sara Beth,

817
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:54,984
- none of this would have happened.
- No.

818
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:58,109
I asked you to help with Sara Beth.
That got us the first riot.

819
00:44:58,192 --> 00:44:59,692
The first riot got us the real riot.

820
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:01,109
- That's not--
- Hang on.

821
00:45:19,734 --> 00:45:21,817
Anyway, I'm telling stories.
I always...

822
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:22,984
I'll add the names.

823
00:45:23,817 --> 00:45:24,817
Thank you.

824
00:45:25,317 --> 00:45:28,692
We move to strike the order
for sequestration of the jury,

825
00:45:28,775 --> 00:45:31,025
which was made by Your Honor,
sua sponte motion--

826
00:45:31,109 --> 00:45:32,275
Hold on.

827
00:45:34,109 --> 00:45:36,275
Mr. Rubin, Mr. Hoffman.

828
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:38,734
What are you wearing?

829
00:45:39,317 --> 00:45:41,859
It's an homage to you, Your Honor.

830
00:45:41,942 --> 00:45:43,567
Do you have clothes underneath there?

831
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:46,275
Yes. Hold on.

832
00:45:47,525 --> 00:45:49,734
- Yes.
- Take off the robes, please.

833
00:45:55,275 --> 00:45:56,359
Silence!

834
00:45:56,442 --> 00:46:00,942
Bailiff, charge Mr. Rubin and Mr. Hoffman
with one count of contempt.

835
00:46:01,025 --> 00:46:02,775
Mr. Kunstler, continue.

836
00:46:04,025 --> 00:46:05,734
We feel that sequestration,

837
00:46:05,817 --> 00:46:09,234
for what appears will be
a considerable period of time, can only--

838
00:46:09,317 --> 00:46:13,442
It would be a considerably shorter period
if the defense made fewer objections.

839
00:46:14,025 --> 00:46:16,275
...can only serve
to the defendants' disadvantage.

840
00:46:16,359 --> 00:46:20,317
The defense will make not one
fewer objection than the prosecution

841
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,734
or this court gives us reason to.

842
00:46:22,817 --> 00:46:28,025
Bailiff, charge Mr. Kunstler
with one count of contempt.

843
00:46:29,609 --> 00:46:32,067
May I continue my argument
so it appears in the record?

844
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:33,359
You may continue.

845
00:46:33,442 --> 00:46:37,067
The jury will be in the custody
of the deputy marshals.

846
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:40,442
The marshals will take care of
all the needs and wants of the jury.

847
00:46:40,525 --> 00:46:44,067
We feel that that tends
to make the jurors sympathetic.

848
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:47,109
The jury are gonna be
taken care of...

849
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:03,275
- Paul Deluca.
- And what is your occupation?

850
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:06,317
I'm a detective with
the police department, City of Chicago.

851
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,984
Calling your attention to
August of 1968 during the convention,

852
00:47:10,067 --> 00:47:12,150
did you have a specific assignment?

853
00:47:12,234 --> 00:47:16,692
To keep Rennie Davis under surveillance
with my partner, Detective Bell.

854
00:47:16,775 --> 00:47:21,692
While you were surveilling Rennie Davis
on the evening of Sunday, August 25th,

855
00:47:21,775 --> 00:47:23,734
the night before the convention began,

856
00:47:23,817 --> 00:47:26,525
did you observe
Tom Hayden committing a crime?

857
00:47:26,609 --> 00:47:30,900
Yes, Mr. Hayden was letting the air out
of the tire of a police vehicle.

858
00:47:32,359 --> 00:47:36,734
The park closes
at 11:00 p.m. by order of the Chicago PD.

859
00:47:36,817 --> 00:47:38,734
You must be out of the park by 11:00 p.m.

860
00:47:39,609 --> 00:47:42,484
Violators will be prosecuted
for trespassing.

861
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,817
I repeat, you must be out of the park.

862
00:48:00,192 --> 00:48:03,359
It's a strategy of throwin' banana peels
all over Chicago,

863
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:05,359
and the machine will stumble.

864
00:48:05,442 --> 00:48:08,567
When it stumbles,
it goes into a policy of overkill

865
00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:10,775
and it starts to devour itself.

866
00:48:11,692 --> 00:48:13,025
We gotta convince 'em.

867
00:48:13,109 --> 00:48:17,275
We gotta convince 'em of what?
That we're crazy enough to do anything.

868
00:48:26,192 --> 00:48:27,734
We think it's important

869
00:48:27,817 --> 00:48:30,734
for confrontational tactical knowledge
to be understood.

870
00:48:30,817 --> 00:48:31,900
You know it!

871
00:48:31,984 --> 00:48:34,442
Right, confrontational tactics
make us safer.

872
00:48:34,525 --> 00:48:35,359
- Yeah.
- Right.

873
00:48:35,442 --> 00:48:37,567
Why?
Because the pigs become afraid.

874
00:48:38,359 --> 00:48:41,359
You know,
and that's fighting fire with what?

875
00:48:41,442 --> 00:48:42,484
Fire!

876
00:48:42,567 --> 00:48:45,692
You don't fight fire with fire.
You fight it with water, jackass.

877
00:48:45,775 --> 00:48:48,525
- It's a metaphor.
- Abbie and his fuckin' banana peels?

878
00:48:48,609 --> 00:48:49,609
Also a metaphor.

879
00:48:49,692 --> 00:48:51,984
Between the cops,
the state police and the Guard,

880
00:48:52,067 --> 00:48:56,109
Daley's got 15,000 soldiers whose guns
are loaded with bullets that are literal.

881
00:48:56,192 --> 00:48:59,775
- I could argue that the bullets are also--
- Yeah, so could I, but don't.

882
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,567
The atmosphere's getting dangerous
and someone's gonna throw a rock.

883
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:06,442
I wanna get the word out
we're protesting the war and not the cops.

884
00:49:06,525 --> 00:49:08,234
- Damn it!
- What?

885
00:49:09,025 --> 00:49:10,192
I think those are my guys.

886
00:49:11,109 --> 00:49:12,442
I think that's their car.

887
00:49:14,025 --> 00:49:17,650
Yep, that's them. They're back.
They were following me all day.

888
00:49:18,609 --> 00:49:21,734
Listen, here's the thing
I haven't told you about Sara Beth.

889
00:49:21,817 --> 00:49:23,900
- She isn't into this at all.
- Isn't into what?

890
00:49:23,984 --> 00:49:26,650
When I'm with her
and her family, I try to...

891
00:49:27,234 --> 00:49:29,609
I de-emphasize the...

892
00:49:30,567 --> 00:49:32,942
- radical revolutionary part of my--
- Got it.

893
00:49:33,025 --> 00:49:34,859
Her parents are letting me stay with them.

894
00:49:34,942 --> 00:49:37,650
If I show up tailed
by two undercover police officers--

895
00:49:37,734 --> 00:49:40,317
- That'll be hard to explain.
- This isn't her world.

896
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,817
It's definitely not her parents' world.

897
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:47,025
- If I bring my world into their driveway--
- You could be in a healthier relationship.

898
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:50,817
I know, but until then,
it's the one I got.

899
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,400
- So that's their car?
- Yep.

900
00:49:55,109 --> 00:49:57,275
- Where are they?
- Looking for me.

901
00:49:58,192 --> 00:50:00,984
All right, go back into the crowd
and let 'em find you.

902
00:50:01,609 --> 00:50:04,067
And then leave the park by the east exit.

903
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:06,942
- They'll need their car to follow you.
- What are you gonna do?

904
00:50:07,025 --> 00:50:10,525
It won't remind anyone of Gandhi,
but a little civil disobedience. Go.

905
00:50:10,609 --> 00:50:13,984
- You're not gonna cut the brakes--
- I'll let the air out of a tire. Go.

906
00:50:14,067 --> 00:50:17,359
I appreciate it.
I don't wanna be a phony with Sara--

907
00:50:17,442 --> 00:50:20,317
- You're welcome. You should really go now.
- Yep.

908
00:50:22,192 --> 00:50:26,067
Detective Bell and I spotted
Rennie Davis walking in the crowd,

909
00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:28,650
and we observed him on foot
for a few minutes.

910
00:50:28,734 --> 00:50:30,067
Then we returned to the unit.

911
00:50:30,150 --> 00:50:31,900
- Your car?
- Yes.

912
00:50:31,984 --> 00:50:33,067
What did you find?

913
00:50:36,025 --> 00:50:38,442
- Don't fuckin' move.
- On your feet.

914
00:50:38,525 --> 00:50:40,692
Those are two contradictory instructions--

915
00:50:42,275 --> 00:50:44,025
All right, hands behind your head.

916
00:50:44,567 --> 00:50:45,817
Spread your legs.

917
00:50:46,442 --> 00:50:49,692
- Was that a contradictory instruction?
- No.

918
00:50:49,775 --> 00:50:52,192
- What happened then?
- Someone from the crowd shouted...

919
00:50:52,275 --> 00:50:55,942
- They're hassling Tom Hayden!
- Paulie, you need to see what I'm seeing.

920
00:50:58,150 --> 00:51:02,192
- Hey! Stay back there! All of ya!
- BELLl Police! Stay back!

921
00:51:02,275 --> 00:51:05,984
- Listen, everybody stay cool.
- Shut up. All right, tell 'em to get back.

922
00:51:06,067 --> 00:51:08,525
- Again, that's a contradict--
- Tell 'em to get back.

923
00:51:08,609 --> 00:51:10,775
Did he tell the crowd to back down?

924
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:13,650
Everybody get back.
I'm all right. Stay cool.

925
00:51:13,734 --> 00:51:15,067
He was egging them on.

926
00:51:15,150 --> 00:51:17,525
Did you take Mr. Hayden under arrest
at that moment?

927
00:51:17,609 --> 00:51:19,275
- No, sir.
- Why not?

928
00:51:19,859 --> 00:51:22,984
- Who's shinin' that?
- Paulie, it's a camera. It's a TV camera.

929
00:51:23,859 --> 00:51:25,900
We wanted to defuse the situation,

930
00:51:25,984 --> 00:51:29,234
so we arranged
to take Mr. Hayden in the next morning.

931
00:51:32,234 --> 00:51:33,442
This is gonna be for me.

932
00:51:33,525 --> 00:51:35,150
Let me try to explain to them.

933
00:51:35,234 --> 00:51:37,192
Tell 'em about Sara Beth's parents.

934
00:51:37,275 --> 00:51:38,734
- Yeah.
- I was kidding.

935
00:51:38,817 --> 00:51:41,192
Just bail me out
and keep to the schedule. It's fine.

936
00:51:41,275 --> 00:51:42,942
- Tom Hayden?
- Yeah.

937
00:51:43,025 --> 00:51:44,775
- See you in a bit.
- You're under arrest.

938
00:51:44,859 --> 00:51:45,859
Got it.

939
00:51:47,150 --> 00:51:50,317
We'll stand in recess for one hour,
and court will resume at 1:30--

940
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,150
Your Honor, I have a motion
I'd like to bring forward.

941
00:51:53,234 --> 00:51:56,192
You wish to address the court, Mr. Seale?

942
00:51:56,275 --> 00:51:59,817
- Yes. I have a motion--
- I will hear you, Mr. Seale.

943
00:52:01,859 --> 00:52:02,859
Just a moment.

944
00:52:03,234 --> 00:52:05,484
Mr. Seale, do you have a motion?

945
00:52:05,567 --> 00:52:09,317
"I, Bobby G. Seale, have a motion
pro se to defend myself."

946
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:12,817
"I'd like to invoke the precedent
of Adams vs. US ex rel. McCann,

947
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:14,484
where the Supreme Court is--"

948
00:52:14,567 --> 00:52:17,442
That's enough.
Where are you learning these things?

949
00:52:17,525 --> 00:52:20,942
Does your young friend Mr. Hampton
have a background in law?

950
00:52:21,025 --> 00:52:24,525
Your Honor, the other defendants
would like to join in Mr. Seale's motion.

951
00:52:24,609 --> 00:52:26,692
Are you now speaking
on behalf of Mr. Seale?

952
00:52:26,775 --> 00:52:30,567
No, Your Honor, I'm speaking
on behalf of the other defendants.

953
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:33,400
You're right next to him.
Why don't you represent him?

954
00:52:33,484 --> 00:52:36,067
Because I'm not his lawyer, sir.

955
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:39,567
And if I understand Mr. Seale,
this last month and a half,

956
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:43,817
and I believe I have,
he is not represented by counsel.

957
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:44,734
Overruled.

958
00:52:44,817 --> 00:52:46,775
- I am being denied right now...
- Mr. Seale...

959
00:52:46,859 --> 00:52:50,609
...my constitutional right
for legal representation--

960
00:52:50,692 --> 00:52:52,109
Will you be quiet!

961
00:52:53,734 --> 00:52:56,192
You have lawyers to speak for you.

962
00:52:56,275 --> 00:52:58,067
No, he doesn't!

963
00:53:13,442 --> 00:53:17,609
Cite Mr. Kunstler
with his second count of contempt.

964
00:53:17,692 --> 00:53:18,859
All rise.

965
00:53:26,109 --> 00:53:30,025
So, Hayden's in a holding cell
on a tire pressure-related charge,

966
00:53:30,109 --> 00:53:33,192
and suddenly, every freak
in Chicago is mobilized.

967
00:53:33,275 --> 00:53:35,067
"They got Hayden!"

968
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:38,067
"We gotta march down
to the police station,

969
00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:41,109
overcome the cops
and the Illinois National Guard

970
00:53:41,192 --> 00:53:42,984
and free Tom Hayden!"

971
00:53:44,317 --> 00:53:46,025
We couldn't find our way out of the park.

972
00:53:48,275 --> 00:53:53,317
Now, over the course of ten days,
the government called 37 witnesses,

973
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:57,109
each and every one of them
an employee of the government.

974
00:53:57,734 --> 00:54:01,359
I call this portion of the trial
"with friends like these."

975
00:54:01,442 --> 00:54:03,525
Rennie, this is Sam. He can be trusted.

976
00:54:04,192 --> 00:54:06,692
Detective Sam McGiven,
Chicago Police Department.

977
00:54:06,775 --> 00:54:08,400
- Abbie, this is Stan.
- Oh, hey.

978
00:54:08,484 --> 00:54:10,400
- Stan Wojohowski.
- How you doin', Stan?

979
00:54:10,484 --> 00:54:13,692
- What is your occupation?
- I'm a Chicago police officer.

980
00:54:13,775 --> 00:54:14,984
Scotty Scibelli, Tom.

981
00:54:15,067 --> 00:54:18,025
I'm your guy for ass, weed
or whatever you need.

982
00:54:18,109 --> 00:54:21,109
Staff Sergeant Scott Scibelli,
Illinois State Police.

983
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:29,067
It's from the woman in the glasses.

984
00:54:32,317 --> 00:54:33,859
- Really?
- Yeah.

985
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:46,192
Hey, uh, did you mean this for me?

986
00:54:46,275 --> 00:54:48,609
- I did.
- Nobody's ever sent me a drink before.

987
00:54:48,692 --> 00:54:51,234
- How do you like it so far?
- It's a Tom Collins.

988
00:54:51,317 --> 00:54:54,192
I know it's a country club drink,
but they're delicious.

989
00:54:54,275 --> 00:54:58,984
A man in England named Tom Collins
claimed in 1894 to have invented it,

990
00:54:59,067 --> 00:55:01,900
but then another man,
whose name I've forgotten, said no,

991
00:55:01,984 --> 00:55:05,692
he'd invented it two years earlier,
and I think there was a lawsuit.

992
00:55:05,775 --> 00:55:08,734
That's a surprising amount of controversy
for gin and lemonade.

993
00:55:09,317 --> 00:55:10,567
- I'm Jerry.
- I know.

994
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:15,525
Jerry, do you know why the French
only eat one egg for breakfast?

995
00:55:15,609 --> 00:55:17,567
- No.
- Because in France,

996
00:55:17,650 --> 00:55:20,275
one egg... is un oeuf.

997
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:23,650
It's un oeuf.

998
00:55:24,317 --> 00:55:26,942
- Wow!
- I know!

999
00:55:27,025 --> 00:55:29,442
I feel so much better
about my Tom Collins story.

1000
00:55:31,150 --> 00:55:32,192
I'm Daphne O'Connor.

1001
00:55:32,275 --> 00:55:35,942
Special Agent Daphne O'Connor,
FBI Counterintelligence.

1002
00:55:36,025 --> 00:55:37,192
Spell your name.

1003
00:55:37,275 --> 00:55:40,900
Think it's possible there were
seven demonstrators in Chicago last summer

1004
00:55:40,984 --> 00:55:43,609
leading 10,000 undercover cops in protest?

1005
00:55:43,692 --> 00:55:45,150
What was your assignment in Chicago?

1006
00:55:45,234 --> 00:55:48,442
To use Jerry Rubin
to infiltrate the leaders of the protest.

1007
00:55:48,525 --> 00:55:52,275
And you were with Jerry Rubin,
Abbie Hoffman, Dave Dellinger

1008
00:55:52,359 --> 00:55:55,442
and Rennie Davis
on the afternoon of the 27th?

1009
00:55:55,525 --> 00:55:56,359
Yes.

1010
00:55:56,442 --> 00:55:59,775
- What were they doing together?
- They were leading a group of protesters.

1011
00:55:59,859 --> 00:56:01,817
- How many, would you say?
- About 800.

1012
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:03,692
Where were they leading these 800 people?

1013
00:56:03,775 --> 00:56:06,692
- To police headquarters at 11th and State.
- Why?

1014
00:56:06,775 --> 00:56:10,692
Tom Hayden was being held there on charges
of tampering with a police vehicle.

1015
00:56:10,775 --> 00:56:13,442
Jerry Rubin said
it was time to "confront the pigs."

1016
00:56:14,109 --> 00:56:16,025
And by "pigs," he meant...

1017
00:56:16,109 --> 00:56:18,317
It was time to confront the police.

1018
00:56:21,275 --> 00:56:22,942
Follow Abbie!

1019
00:56:23,609 --> 00:56:25,484
Marshals, we're on the move.

1020
00:56:29,317 --> 00:56:33,109
I remember also at the front of the group
was Mr. Allen Ginsberg.

1021
00:56:33,192 --> 00:56:34,817
Allen Ginsberg, the poet?

1022
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:37,692
Yes, he was chanting a kind of war chant.

1023
00:56:37,775 --> 00:56:40,984
- Om.
- What's he doing?

1024
00:56:41,067 --> 00:56:43,150
He's channeling the energy.
Settling things down.

1025
00:56:43,234 --> 00:56:44,609
And how's that workin' so far?

1026
00:56:44,692 --> 00:56:47,609
- Our streets!
- Our streets!

1027
00:56:47,692 --> 00:56:51,650
- Our streets!
- Our streets!

1028
00:56:51,734 --> 00:56:56,484
The guy testified that Ginsberg
was letting out a war chant,

1029
00:56:56,567 --> 00:57:00,442
some kinda fucking jungle signal
to Beat poets,

1030
00:57:00,525 --> 00:57:04,275
that they should begin
pelting the troops with blank verse.

1031
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:09,859
So, a guy in the crowd is marching
with a girl on his shoulders.

1032
00:57:09,942 --> 00:57:12,400
She's waving an American flag,

1033
00:57:12,484 --> 00:57:16,109
and this seems to really
be bothering some frat brothers

1034
00:57:16,192 --> 00:57:18,900
who'd come to town
in the spirit of fraternity.

1035
00:57:18,984 --> 00:57:22,317
- Put down the flag!
- Hey, put the flag down!

1036
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:25,400
Can you hear us?
Are you fucking deaf, you bitch?

1037
00:57:25,484 --> 00:57:29,567
- Put the flag down!
- Go to the kitchen and make me a sandwich!

1038
00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:31,859
I'm gonna go back there
and take care of that.

1039
00:57:31,942 --> 00:57:33,234
They are not the enemy.

1040
00:57:33,317 --> 00:57:35,067
In so many fuckin' ways, they are.

1041
00:57:37,525 --> 00:57:41,984
Free Tom Hayden!
Free Tom Hayden!

1042
00:57:45,692 --> 00:57:47,900
The group turned left on 11th Street.

1043
00:57:47,984 --> 00:57:49,900
We make a left on 11th Street.

1044
00:57:49,984 --> 00:57:51,067
That's when they saw it.

1045
00:57:51,150 --> 00:57:55,692
Free Tom Hayden!

1046
00:57:55,775 --> 00:57:58,567
Free Tom Hayden!

1047
00:57:58,650 --> 00:58:00,942
Free Tom Hayden!

1048
00:58:01,025 --> 00:58:02,484
Holy shit!

1049
00:58:06,942 --> 00:58:08,650
Are they about to conquer Spain?

1050
00:58:10,817 --> 00:58:13,609
Free Tom Hayden!

1051
00:58:13,692 --> 00:58:14,692
Fuck it.

1052
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:18,317
- What do you mean, "Fuck it"?
- This is it. It's time.

1053
00:58:19,025 --> 00:58:21,859
- We're not rushing the police.
- Why the fuck not?

1054
00:58:21,942 --> 00:58:25,109
- We'll be critically injured.
- Tom doesn't want anyone hurt.

1055
00:58:25,192 --> 00:58:27,359
Turn this crowd around.
There's too much momentum.

1056
00:58:27,442 --> 00:58:30,150
- Turn 'em around and calm them down.
- What are we doin'?

1057
00:58:30,234 --> 00:58:33,400
He's right. This is not safe.
I know something about this. Come on.

1058
00:58:33,484 --> 00:58:35,442
Marshals, turn 'em around
and slow 'em down.

1059
00:58:35,525 --> 00:58:37,984
Looks like the Alamo back here.
Turn 'em around.

1060
00:58:38,067 --> 00:58:40,859
- Bring 'em safely to the park.
- We should be marching up to them.

1061
00:58:40,942 --> 00:58:42,984
I don't think they'll surrender, man.

1062
00:58:43,567 --> 00:58:47,275
Keep 'em movin'. Dave and I
are gonna stay and make Tom's bail.

1063
00:58:47,359 --> 00:58:48,567
Back to the park!

1064
00:58:49,650 --> 00:58:51,525
I don't carry money, do you?

1065
00:58:52,192 --> 00:58:54,484
I do. I'm a grown man.

1066
00:58:54,567 --> 00:58:55,900
Om.

1067
00:58:55,984 --> 00:58:58,400
You're killin' me, Allen.
You're goddamn killing me!

1068
00:58:58,484 --> 00:59:00,984
The marshals are spreading word
that we gotta keep moving.

1069
00:59:01,067 --> 00:59:03,609
"Go left on Roosevelt
and back in the park," right?

1070
00:59:03,692 --> 00:59:04,984
When they got to the park,

1071
00:59:05,067 --> 00:59:07,984
three divisions of police officers
had moved in from the south.

1072
00:59:27,692 --> 00:59:31,025
I don't know
what tactical genius came up with that,

1073
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:32,775
but you know when shit happens?

1074
00:59:32,859 --> 00:59:35,984
When you don't give protesters
a place to go.

1075
00:59:36,067 --> 00:59:38,359
How would you characterize
the mood of the crowd?

1076
00:59:38,442 --> 00:59:42,734
The witness is in no position to
characterize the mood of 1,000 strangers.

1077
00:59:42,817 --> 00:59:44,192
Do you have an objection?

1078
00:59:44,275 --> 00:59:46,150
- Yes, sir.
- On what grounds?

1079
00:59:46,234 --> 00:59:47,234
On those grounds.

1080
00:59:47,817 --> 00:59:49,234
Overruled.

1081
00:59:49,317 --> 00:59:51,275
I will clear this courtroom.

1082
00:59:52,650 --> 00:59:53,817
Mr. Wojohowski?

1083
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:55,317
The crowd was looking for a fight.

1084
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:58,484
You're pigs! Your children are pigs!

1085
00:59:58,567 --> 01:00:00,775
No, we should leave
their children out of it.

1086
01:00:00,859 --> 01:00:02,275
You're right. I know.

1087
01:00:02,359 --> 01:00:04,900
"White honky MFers, get out of our park."

1088
01:00:04,984 --> 01:00:06,359
And then he said, "Look at 'em."

1089
01:00:06,442 --> 01:00:07,859
They don't look so tough.

1090
01:00:08,525 --> 01:00:10,442
Well, the guns...

1091
01:00:10,525 --> 01:00:12,775
There are no permits
for this demonstration.

1092
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:14,817
You're ordered
to leave the park, immediately!

1093
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:17,317
Put down your guns, motherfuckers!

1094
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:18,942
Fight like fuckin' men!

1095
01:00:19,025 --> 01:00:21,609
Just so you know,
I do not have your back on that.

1096
01:00:21,692 --> 01:00:26,234
And the guys from Kappa Gamma Douchebag,
who were hassling the girl?

1097
01:00:26,317 --> 01:00:28,025
They're back.

1098
01:00:28,109 --> 01:00:30,900
Put down the goddamn flag, you cunt!

1099
01:00:30,984 --> 01:00:32,900
- Go make me a sandwich!
- Put it down!

1100
01:00:32,984 --> 01:00:34,859
- Put the flag down!
- Calm down!

1101
01:00:34,942 --> 01:00:37,400
Help me calm 'em down, Jerry!

1102
01:00:37,484 --> 01:00:40,234
Baby, defuse the situation.
They will listen to you.

1103
01:00:40,317 --> 01:00:41,984
- Huh.
- What?

1104
01:00:42,067 --> 01:00:44,317
Nothing, that sounded nice
when you said it.

1105
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:45,567
- Right now!
- Yeah.

1106
01:00:45,650 --> 01:00:48,900
- Someone from the crowd shouts...
- A guy in the crowd shouts...

1107
01:00:48,984 --> 01:00:50,859
Someone in the crowd shouted...

1108
01:00:50,942 --> 01:00:52,109
Take the hill!

1109
01:00:52,192 --> 01:00:56,275
Hey! Stop running! Hey, everybody!

1110
01:00:56,359 --> 01:00:59,609
The street name
for chloroacetophenone is tear gas.

1111
01:00:59,692 --> 01:01:00,692
Fire!

1112
01:01:01,609 --> 01:01:04,192
And it's a fuckin' blowtorch.

1113
01:01:04,275 --> 01:01:06,692
Your lungs, your skin, your eyes...

1114
01:01:06,775 --> 01:01:08,317
- Go, go!
- Riot clubs?

1115
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:11,192
They're made out of the same wood
they use for baseball bats.

1116
01:01:30,942 --> 01:01:33,192
Let me go!

1117
01:01:42,234 --> 01:01:43,650
Put the flag down!

1118
01:01:48,317 --> 01:01:50,859
- Hey!
- You shut your fuckin' mouth!

1119
01:01:50,942 --> 01:01:52,609
What are you doing?

1120
01:01:52,692 --> 01:01:54,234
You got this coming!

1121
01:01:54,317 --> 01:01:57,859
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Hey! Hey, get the fuck off of her!

1122
01:01:57,942 --> 01:01:59,234
What's the matter with you?

1123
01:01:59,317 --> 01:02:00,525
Fuck you, hippie faggot!

1124
01:02:03,192 --> 01:02:04,567
You're all right.

1125
01:02:04,650 --> 01:02:06,609
You're okay. Here.

1126
01:02:06,692 --> 01:02:09,734
You gotta just hold this
over your face, okay?

1127
01:02:09,817 --> 01:02:12,025
I'm gonna take you
to the first-aid station.

1128
01:02:12,109 --> 01:02:13,567
You're all right. I got you.

1129
01:02:13,650 --> 01:02:16,150
We have to go.
Okay, I'm gonna get you out of here.

1130
01:02:16,234 --> 01:02:17,484
I'm gonna...

1131
01:02:20,067 --> 01:02:21,609
Don't move, Jerry.

1132
01:02:21,692 --> 01:02:24,400
- Man, get those guys. They were--
- You're under arrest.

1133
01:02:25,567 --> 01:02:29,525
Everybody gather
in the center of the park...

1134
01:02:30,067 --> 01:02:31,942
After bailing out Tom Hayden,

1135
01:02:32,025 --> 01:02:36,359
Abbie, Dave and Tom returned to the park.
Is that correct?

1136
01:02:42,692 --> 01:02:44,567
Sir, can you look at me? Sir?

1137
01:02:50,484 --> 01:02:51,484
Get in.

1138
01:02:55,734 --> 01:02:57,025
I'll be honest.

1139
01:02:57,109 --> 01:02:59,984
I was starting to worry about
getting everyone out of Chicago alive.

1140
01:03:00,067 --> 01:03:02,484
- That's not really up to us.
- Yeah, it is.

1141
01:03:03,192 --> 01:03:05,692
What are you lookin' at me for?
I went to bail you out.

1142
01:03:06,275 --> 01:03:08,442
800 people followed you?

1143
01:03:08,525 --> 01:03:12,442
Oh, that. Yeah, people follow me.
Hell if I know why.

1144
01:03:12,525 --> 01:03:14,234
I'm racking my brain as well.

1145
01:03:14,317 --> 01:03:15,984
How'd you make bail so fast?

1146
01:03:16,067 --> 01:03:18,525
I wasn't arrested, I was detained.

1147
01:03:18,609 --> 01:03:20,984
They couldn't figure out
what to charge me with.

1148
01:03:21,067 --> 01:03:22,067
Assault.

1149
01:03:23,609 --> 01:03:26,275
I was assaulting someone
who was assaulting someone.

1150
01:03:26,359 --> 01:03:27,442
- So--
- Okay, guys.

1151
01:03:27,525 --> 01:03:30,400
Nothing is more dangerous
than a crowd of people moving.

1152
01:03:30,484 --> 01:03:33,025
It's like trying to redirect
the Mississippi River.

1153
01:03:33,942 --> 01:03:36,275
- Isn't she great?
- Get your people to cool off.

1154
01:03:36,359 --> 01:03:38,859
- We're responsible for these people.
- Tommy.

1155
01:03:38,942 --> 01:03:41,109
We have to protest
in front of the convention.

1156
01:03:41,192 --> 01:03:44,442
Plain and simple.
'Cause that's where the cameras are.

1157
01:03:44,525 --> 01:03:48,109
We have to get to the convention.
That means we have to leave the park.

1158
01:03:48,192 --> 01:03:49,942
And that's when people'll get hurt.

1159
01:03:50,025 --> 01:03:54,025
As long as every person following me
knows that, then I sleep fine at night.

1160
01:03:54,109 --> 01:03:55,650
Tell me how you do it.

1161
01:03:55,734 --> 01:03:57,525
- A lot of it is drugs.
- Yeah?

1162
01:03:58,109 --> 01:04:00,650
This is what happened
when we try to go up a hill.

1163
01:04:01,650 --> 01:04:04,442
We're not getting
anywhere near the convention.

1164
01:04:06,192 --> 01:04:10,859
Special Agent O'Connor,
you testified that Jerry Rubin said,

1165
01:04:10,942 --> 01:04:15,525
"Fuck 'em all. They're all pigs.
We should form an army and get guns."

1166
01:04:16,150 --> 01:04:16,984
Yes.

1167
01:04:17,067 --> 01:04:20,025
And when he said that,
did anyone form an army and get guns?

1168
01:04:20,109 --> 01:04:20,942
No.

1169
01:04:21,025 --> 01:04:24,609
Did Jerry Rubin instruct the crowd
to run into the park?

1170
01:04:25,192 --> 01:04:26,984
- No.
- Did Rennie Davis?

1171
01:04:27,067 --> 01:04:29,775
- No.
- Was Abbie Hoffman even there?

1172
01:04:29,859 --> 01:04:31,734
- No.
- Was Dave Dellinger?

1173
01:04:31,817 --> 01:04:33,817
- No.
- John Froines there?

1174
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:35,275
- No.
- Lee Weiner?

1175
01:04:36,150 --> 01:04:37,234
No, he wasn't there.

1176
01:04:37,317 --> 01:04:39,859
You testified that Jerry and Rennie...

1177
01:04:39,942 --> 01:04:41,692
Can you say it for me again?

1178
01:04:41,775 --> 01:04:44,400
That they were trying
to turn the people around

1179
01:04:44,484 --> 01:04:47,859
and send them back down the hill
just like you told them to.

1180
01:04:48,775 --> 01:04:49,984
Is that correct?

1181
01:04:54,650 --> 01:04:57,484
Mr. Kunstler, the demonstrators
attacked the police

1182
01:04:57,567 --> 01:04:58,900
and the police responded.

1183
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:04,484
And are any of those demonstrators
that you saw attacking the police

1184
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:06,859
sitting here at the defense table?

1185
01:05:06,942 --> 01:05:09,567
- No, sir.
- Well, thank you.

1186
01:05:10,067 --> 01:05:11,984
No further questions.

1187
01:05:12,067 --> 01:05:14,067
- The court will stand--
- I wasn't there, either.

1188
01:05:14,150 --> 01:05:15,942
- Mr. Seale--
- I wasn't there at all.

1189
01:05:16,025 --> 01:05:18,317
I should be allowed
to cross-examine this witness!

1190
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:20,984
- We will stand in recess until--
- Four hours!

1191
01:05:21,067 --> 01:05:22,067
Mr. Hampton!

1192
01:05:22,150 --> 01:05:24,025
That's how long Bobby Seale
was in Chicago.

1193
01:05:24,109 --> 01:05:25,692
- Quiet!
- Four hours!

1194
01:05:33,150 --> 01:05:34,359
All rise.

1195
01:05:39,317 --> 01:05:42,234
The court will stand in recess
for the weekend.

1196
01:05:49,359 --> 01:05:51,067
Yeah, I took in the exhibit.

1197
01:05:51,150 --> 01:05:52,984
I cleared my mind.

1198
01:05:54,442 --> 01:05:57,109
Stood there for 20 minutes.
I felt nothing.

1199
01:05:58,942 --> 01:06:03,442
Well, but it wasn't a painting,
it was an exhibit.

1200
01:06:04,150 --> 01:06:05,609
It was a natural history museum.

1201
01:06:05,692 --> 01:06:08,609
And when you put exhibits
of Native Indian families

1202
01:06:08,692 --> 01:06:10,234
in a natural history museum

1203
01:06:10,317 --> 01:06:13,484
alongside dioramas of early man
and the Jurassic age,

1204
01:06:13,567 --> 01:06:18,317
it gives the impression that the Cherokee
evolved into modern-day Europeans.

1205
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:20,525
Look who it is.

1206
01:06:21,109 --> 01:06:23,067
I got a bone to pick with that guy.

1207
01:06:23,150 --> 01:06:24,317
Hey, Counselor.

1208
01:06:25,692 --> 01:06:27,942
- No colleges this weekend?
- Winter break.

1209
01:06:28,025 --> 01:06:30,692
- My audience went home to their parents.
- Mm-hmm.

1210
01:06:30,775 --> 01:06:32,317
Are these ladies related to you?

1211
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,775
These are my daughters.
This is Emily and Julie.

1212
01:06:34,859 --> 01:06:36,192
Your dad's a good guy.

1213
01:06:36,275 --> 01:06:39,234
That's coming from someone
who he's trying hard to put in prison.

1214
01:06:39,317 --> 01:06:41,275
We shouldn't be talking
without your lawyer.

1215
01:06:41,359 --> 01:06:42,609
We're all on the same team.

1216
01:06:43,234 --> 01:06:46,650
In a sense, I guess,
but in a much truer sense, we're not.

1217
01:06:46,734 --> 01:06:49,150
Girls, here, take this dollar

1218
01:06:49,234 --> 01:06:52,900
and go over to those musicians
and put it in their hat, okay?

1219
01:06:52,984 --> 01:06:55,942
And here's a quarter.
Go buy some of those candy-coated peanuts

1220
01:06:56,025 --> 01:06:59,025
that your mom won't let you have.
All right? Shh.

1221
01:06:59,984 --> 01:07:01,859
- Sweet kids.
- Thank you.

1222
01:07:01,942 --> 01:07:06,525
If your lawyer were here, I'd tell you
the window's closing for you to plead out.

1223
01:07:07,109 --> 01:07:09,442
We're not taking a fuckin' deal.
Would you stop?

1224
01:07:10,025 --> 01:07:12,984
I wish I could share Abbie's sentiment
that you're a good guy,

1225
01:07:13,067 --> 01:07:14,234
but I'm afraid I can't.

1226
01:07:14,817 --> 01:07:16,317
I'm sorry to hear that.

1227
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:20,317
Sending Daphne O'Connor
to break my heart was way out of line.

1228
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:22,692
Well, I don't work for the FBI,

1229
01:07:22,775 --> 01:07:25,817
but O'Connor was one of many agents
sent to gather intelligence

1230
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:27,859
on what had been deemed a credible threat.

1231
01:07:27,942 --> 01:07:31,984
Fine. Then you bug our phones,
you wire up a dope dealer. Be a man.

1232
01:07:32,067 --> 01:07:35,942
- You don't send a woman to ensorcell me.
- What?

1233
01:07:36,025 --> 01:07:37,734
- It means to enchant.
- Oh.

1234
01:07:37,817 --> 01:07:41,567
- Only to have her crush my soul.
- How long did you two know each other?

1235
01:07:42,150 --> 01:07:45,359
Ninety-three hours.
Could've been a lifetime.

1236
01:07:45,442 --> 01:07:47,567
For a fruit fly. Enjoy your weekend.

1237
01:07:47,650 --> 01:07:49,359
Is that even ethical?

1238
01:07:50,234 --> 01:07:51,567
Aren't there ethics rules?

1239
01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:53,192
Did she engage with you sexually?

1240
01:07:54,984 --> 01:07:56,734
Well, we were takin' it slow.

1241
01:07:57,692 --> 01:07:59,317
He's gonna be all right.

1242
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:00,650
One egg is un oeuf?

1243
01:08:01,609 --> 01:08:04,234
- They teach her that at the Academy?
- Yep.

1244
01:08:04,317 --> 01:08:06,150
We don't have any beef with you.

1245
01:08:06,234 --> 01:08:09,192
We know you're doing your job
and you don't think we're criminals.

1246
01:08:09,275 --> 01:08:10,984
I'm not sure where you get that info,

1247
01:08:11,067 --> 01:08:13,775
but I represent the People
without passion or prejudice.

1248
01:08:14,359 --> 01:08:16,234
You think we were responsible?

1249
01:08:16,817 --> 01:08:18,609
You got the result you were looking for.

1250
01:08:19,525 --> 01:08:22,484
- So did Nixon.
- How 'bout that?

1251
01:08:23,442 --> 01:08:24,525
See you Monday.

1252
01:08:26,359 --> 01:08:27,650
Does she ever mention me?

1253
01:08:52,025 --> 01:08:53,192
Conspiracy Office.

1254
01:08:59,525 --> 01:09:00,525
I need a second.

1255
01:09:07,317 --> 01:09:08,650
Something's happened, Tom.

1256
01:09:28,984 --> 01:09:30,275
Bobby, uh...

1257
01:09:32,859 --> 01:09:35,650
Fred Hampton
was shot and killed last night.

1258
01:09:39,067 --> 01:09:43,234
There was a police raid,
and there was a shootout.

1259
01:09:43,942 --> 01:09:45,150
And he's dead.

1260
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:51,067
- It took place between the hours of 4:00--
- I know.

1261
01:09:51,942 --> 01:09:54,692
- You were told?
- Yeah.

1262
01:09:54,775 --> 01:09:55,859
Um...

1263
01:09:57,150 --> 01:09:58,525
I'm so sorry.

1264
01:10:06,567 --> 01:10:09,317
The seven of you,
you've all got the same father, right?

1265
01:10:11,442 --> 01:10:12,942
I'm talkin' to you.

1266
01:10:15,150 --> 01:10:17,400
You all got the same father, right?

1267
01:10:17,484 --> 01:10:19,067
"Cut your hair...

1268
01:10:20,025 --> 01:10:25,317
don't be a fag, respect authority,
respect America, respect me."

1269
01:10:27,359 --> 01:10:30,984
Your life, it's a "fuck you"
to your father, right?

1270
01:10:33,150 --> 01:10:34,150
A little?

1271
01:10:36,067 --> 01:10:38,359
- Maybe.
- Maybe.

1272
01:10:39,025 --> 01:10:41,817
And you can see how that's different
from a rope on a tree?

1273
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:43,900
Yeah.

1274
01:10:44,442 --> 01:10:45,442
Yeah.

1275
01:10:49,025 --> 01:10:50,900
He was shot in the shoulder first.

1276
01:10:52,692 --> 01:10:55,150
You can't aim a gun
if you've been shot in the shoulder.

1277
01:10:55,234 --> 01:10:56,775
You can't squeeze the trigger.

1278
01:10:58,025 --> 01:10:59,817
Second shot was in his head.

1279
01:11:02,317 --> 01:11:03,942
Fred was executed.

1280
01:11:08,650 --> 01:11:09,650
Anything else?

1281
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:14,900
No.

1282
01:11:27,609 --> 01:11:31,359
Calling your attention
to the evening of the next day,

1283
01:11:31,442 --> 01:11:34,859
Tuesday, August 27th,
were you in Grant Park?

1284
01:11:34,942 --> 01:11:38,734
Yes. There was
a "Free Huey Newton" rally going on.

1285
01:11:38,817 --> 01:11:42,609
- WOMAN Recognize any of the speakers?
- I heard Jerry Rubin give a speech.

1286
01:11:42,692 --> 01:11:45,192
Phil Ochs sang,
and then Bobby Seale gave a speech.

1287
01:11:45,275 --> 01:11:48,942
I object to this testimony against me
because I have been denied counsel.

1288
01:11:50,067 --> 01:11:51,067
We understand.

1289
01:11:51,567 --> 01:11:54,234
Do you recall any of Mr. Seale's speech?

1290
01:11:54,317 --> 01:11:55,400
Yes. He said--

1291
01:11:55,484 --> 01:11:57,442
- I object to this man's--
- Quiet!

1292
01:11:58,359 --> 01:11:59,192
Go ahead.

1293
01:11:59,275 --> 01:12:01,817
- May I refer to notes?
- Yes.

1294
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:07,109
He said, "We must
understand that as we go forth

1295
01:12:07,192 --> 01:12:09,150
to try to move
the reprobate politicians..."

1296
01:12:09,234 --> 01:12:10,067
Your Honor--

1297
01:12:10,150 --> 01:12:13,984
"...our cowardly Congress,
the jive, double-lip talking Nixon--"

1298
01:12:14,067 --> 01:12:16,317
"Jive, double-lip, talking Nixon..."

1299
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:19,984
You're making me sound like
one funky cat. Thank you, sir.

1300
01:12:20,067 --> 01:12:22,192
Last warning, Mr. Seale.

1301
01:12:24,150 --> 01:12:25,775
Did he say anything else?

1302
01:12:25,859 --> 01:12:28,150
He said, "The revolution at this time

1303
01:12:28,234 --> 01:12:32,317
is directly connected
to organized guns in force."

1304
01:12:34,525 --> 01:12:35,525
No more questions.

1305
01:12:37,275 --> 01:12:41,150
Jive, double-lip talking.
Funky, funky cat.

1306
01:12:41,234 --> 01:12:43,775
Would the defense like
to cross-examine the witness?

1307
01:12:43,859 --> 01:12:48,150
Yes. I'm sittin' here saying that I would
like to cross-examine a witness.

1308
01:12:48,234 --> 01:12:51,150
- Only lawyers can address a witness.
- My lawyer is Charles Garry.

1309
01:12:51,234 --> 01:12:54,734
- I'm tired of hearing that.
- Couldn't care less what you're tired of.

1310
01:12:55,525 --> 01:12:56,525
What did you say?

1311
01:12:59,025 --> 01:13:04,109
I said it would be impossible for me
to care any less what you are tired of.

1312
01:13:04,192 --> 01:13:07,192
And I demand to cross-examine the witness.

1313
01:13:07,275 --> 01:13:09,400
Sit in your chair and be quiet.

1314
01:13:09,484 --> 01:13:13,109
And don't ever address this court
in that manner again.

1315
01:13:16,984 --> 01:13:18,650
Are there any further questions?

1316
01:13:20,734 --> 01:13:23,942
We'll stand in recess for one hour,
and court will resume again--

1317
01:13:24,025 --> 01:13:27,150
- It was premeditated murder!
- Yes, it was!

1318
01:13:27,234 --> 01:13:30,984
- Fred Hampton was assassinated last night!
- Marshals, put Mr. Seale--

1319
01:13:31,067 --> 01:13:33,025
He wouldn't have been able to hold a gun!

1320
01:13:33,109 --> 01:13:37,859
When they publish the coroner's report,
ask about the bullet in his shoulder!

1321
01:13:41,234 --> 01:13:44,359
I strongly caution you, Mr. Seale.

1322
01:13:45,192 --> 01:13:46,942
I strongly caution--

1323
01:13:47,025 --> 01:13:49,609
Oh, strongly fuck yourself!

1324
01:13:52,817 --> 01:13:55,025
Marshals, take that defendant into a room

1325
01:13:55,109 --> 01:13:57,692
and deal with him
as he should be dealt with.

1326
01:15:24,359 --> 01:15:29,317
Let the record show
that I tried, fairly and impartially.

1327
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:33,400
I tried to get the defendant
to sit on his own.

1328
01:15:33,484 --> 01:15:35,692
I ask you again, Mr. Seale,

1329
01:15:35,775 --> 01:15:39,234
and you may indicate
by raising your head up and down,

1330
01:15:39,817 --> 01:15:42,067
or moving it from side to side,

1331
01:15:42,150 --> 01:15:47,525
if I have your assurance that you will
not do anything to disrupt this trial,

1332
01:15:47,609 --> 01:15:50,650
if I allow you to resume proper order.

1333
01:15:51,942 --> 01:15:54,025
Do I have your assurance?

1334
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:05,109
Mr. Schultz, call your next witness.

1335
01:16:09,734 --> 01:16:10,942
Mr. Schultz?

1336
01:16:20,025 --> 01:16:21,234
Your Honor, may we approach?

1337
01:16:27,234 --> 01:16:28,484
Can he breathe?

1338
01:16:29,317 --> 01:16:31,192
Can you breathe all right, Bobby?

1339
01:16:37,609 --> 01:16:41,150
Your Honor, our defendant is gagged
and bound in an American courtroom.

1340
01:16:41,234 --> 01:16:43,109
He brought it on himself.

1341
01:16:43,192 --> 01:16:44,192
Are you insane?

1342
01:16:44,234 --> 01:16:45,359
Mr. Kunstler.

1343
01:16:46,942 --> 01:16:48,484
Love of God.

1344
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:52,192
What do you want, Mr. Schultz?
This is your sidebar.

1345
01:16:52,275 --> 01:16:55,859
The government would like to make a motion
that Bobby Seale be separated--

1346
01:16:55,942 --> 01:16:57,942
- Wait, wait, wait--
- Sir, please.

1347
01:16:58,567 --> 01:17:01,525
A motion that Bobby Seale be separated
from the rest of the defendants

1348
01:17:01,609 --> 01:17:03,734
and his case be declared a mistrial.

1349
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:06,192
You want me to give him his mistrial?

1350
01:17:06,275 --> 01:17:10,859
Of course, because you took that Black guy
and you made him a sympathetic character.

1351
01:17:10,942 --> 01:17:15,609
Mr. Kunstler, I have lived
a very long time, sir.

1352
01:17:15,692 --> 01:17:18,817
And you're the first person ever

1353
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:23,192
to suggest that I have discriminated
against a Black man.

1354
01:17:23,275 --> 01:17:25,192
Then let the record show
that I am the second.

1355
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:29,400
Step back.

1356
01:17:43,942 --> 01:17:48,109
I'm issuing an order declaring a mistrial
as to the defendant Bobby G. Seale.

1357
01:17:57,817 --> 01:18:02,692
Mr. Seale, you are currently charged
with 16 counts of contempt

1358
01:18:02,775 --> 01:18:05,775
for your repeated displays of disrespect,

1359
01:18:05,859 --> 01:18:09,692
and you have a pending homicide charge
in Connecticut.

1360
01:18:10,484 --> 01:18:15,150
You are not home free, sir,
and I doubt you ever will be.

1361
01:18:16,484 --> 01:18:20,650
We are adjourned until 10:00, Monday.

1362
01:18:20,734 --> 01:18:21,900
All rise.

1363
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:57,484
Conspiracy Office, how can I help you?

1364
01:19:03,317 --> 01:19:05,442
No, sir. I am a white woman.

1365
01:19:09,192 --> 01:19:12,859
Yeah, I've slept with several
in my life so far, and on balance,

1366
01:19:12,942 --> 01:19:14,484
I'd have to say it is better.

1367
01:19:14,567 --> 01:19:16,942
I think that's a big part
of what's got you worked up.

1368
01:19:17,025 --> 01:19:17,859
Hang up the phone.

1369
01:19:17,942 --> 01:19:20,609
It's not so much that it's bigger.
It's just better.

1370
01:19:20,692 --> 01:19:21,692
Hang up the phone.

1371
01:19:24,109 --> 01:19:26,025
Was that a parting gift for Bobby?

1372
01:19:27,067 --> 01:19:29,609
No. That was just for me.

1373
01:19:43,067 --> 01:19:45,234
Why the fuck did you stand up?

1374
01:19:45,984 --> 01:19:46,859
It was a reflex.

1375
01:19:46,942 --> 01:19:48,734
He was respecting the institution.

1376
01:19:48,817 --> 01:19:52,900
I don't know what good it does to insult
the judge in view of the jury, the press,

1377
01:19:52,984 --> 01:19:56,359
and Foran and Schultz, who'll recommend
sentencing if we're convicted.

1378
01:19:56,442 --> 01:19:59,775
It's a revolution, Tom.
We may have to hurt somebody's feelings.

1379
01:20:02,234 --> 01:20:03,525
So, um...

1380
01:20:04,817 --> 01:20:06,400
we have this list.

1381
01:20:06,484 --> 01:20:09,942
Maybe Monday morning,
we could read the names into the record

1382
01:20:10,025 --> 01:20:11,150
as a way of saying--

1383
01:20:11,234 --> 01:20:12,067
Saying what?

1384
01:20:12,150 --> 01:20:16,442
That whatever we're facing, you know,
it's peanuts compared to what--

1385
01:20:16,525 --> 01:20:19,734
He's gonna sentence us.
The judge decides what we're facing.

1386
01:20:19,817 --> 01:20:22,650
- It is a goddamn trial.
- Political trial.

1387
01:20:22,734 --> 01:20:26,109
No, we were arrested... The law
doesn't recognize political trials.

1388
01:20:26,192 --> 01:20:29,067
No, we weren't arrested.
We were chosen.

1389
01:20:32,109 --> 01:20:35,567
Lee, John, have you guys asked yourselves
what you're doing here?

1390
01:20:35,650 --> 01:20:36,484
Every day.

1391
01:20:36,567 --> 01:20:38,067
You're a give-back.

1392
01:20:38,150 --> 01:20:40,692
They give the jury
a couple of guys they can acquit

1393
01:20:40,775 --> 01:20:43,567
so they feel better
about finding the rest of us guilty.

1394
01:20:46,567 --> 01:20:48,359
Lenny, am I wrong?

1395
01:20:49,734 --> 01:20:50,567
No.

1396
01:20:50,650 --> 01:20:54,650
Wait, so our role in history is that
we made it easier to convict our friends?

1397
01:20:54,734 --> 01:20:57,525
They're gonna find us guilty
if they just don't like you.

1398
01:20:57,609 --> 01:20:59,984
That's why Bill won't put us on the stand.

1399
01:21:00,067 --> 01:21:02,650
I can take the stand.
I'm easier for them to like.

1400
01:21:03,567 --> 01:21:05,609
I'm literally a Boy Scout troop leader.

1401
01:21:10,942 --> 01:21:13,275
You're a conscientious objector.

1402
01:21:13,359 --> 01:21:15,234
A lot of people
are conscientious objectors.

1403
01:21:15,317 --> 01:21:16,484
During World War II?

1404
01:21:16,567 --> 01:21:20,109
You sat out World War II.
Even I wanna punch you.

1405
01:21:20,192 --> 01:21:23,442
- We can talk about that.
- I'm looking forward to it.

1406
01:21:23,525 --> 01:21:25,192
I could take the stand.

1407
01:21:25,275 --> 01:21:27,900
Mr. Rubin, you ever taught a classroom
how to make a bomb?

1408
01:21:27,984 --> 01:21:30,900
Man, eighth graders are taught
how Oppenheimer made a bomb.

1409
01:21:30,984 --> 01:21:34,109
Not one you can build
with materials from Woolworth's.

1410
01:21:34,192 --> 01:21:35,609
You know what'd be ironic?

1411
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:38,400
- What?
- I said, know what--

1412
01:21:38,484 --> 01:21:40,734
He heard you.
He's asking what would be ironic.

1413
01:21:40,817 --> 01:21:45,525
I was gonna say if John Mitchell did
all this just to get back at Ramsey Clark.

1414
01:21:45,609 --> 01:21:47,569
- For what?
- That thing, remember?

1415
01:21:47,650 --> 01:21:50,359
Outgoing cabinet members
are supposed to resign,

1416
01:21:50,442 --> 01:21:53,234
but Ramsey Clark didn't tender
his resignation till--

1417
01:21:53,317 --> 01:21:55,359
I read Mitchell
had a fit about that.

1418
01:21:55,442 --> 01:21:58,400
- Yeah.
- Did you read about that, Lenny?

1419
01:21:58,984 --> 01:21:59,984
Bill?

1420
01:22:00,942 --> 01:22:03,067
He was never even on our witness list.

1421
01:22:03,150 --> 01:22:04,150
Who?

1422
01:22:04,234 --> 01:22:08,817
- The first witness you put on the stand--
- If this was a political trial...

1423
01:22:09,650 --> 01:22:11,400
- Bernadine.
- Yeah.

1424
01:22:11,484 --> 01:22:13,775
I need my office to find Ramsey Clark.

1425
01:22:14,525 --> 01:22:17,275
And William Kunstler just showed up.

1426
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:33,400
Len.

1427
01:22:38,275 --> 01:22:41,400
Maybe... I don't know,
does he have a Secret Service detail?

1428
01:22:41,484 --> 01:22:44,525
Nah, they're here for us.

1429
01:22:50,150 --> 01:22:52,442
He was the attorney general.
What do we do?

1430
01:22:52,525 --> 01:22:55,400
- We just ring the doorbell?
- Yeah, I guess so.

1431
01:22:56,942 --> 01:22:59,234
- You wanna do it?
- Just ring the damn...

1432
01:23:04,900 --> 01:23:08,109
Good morning, I'm Bill Kunstler.
Mr. Clark is expecting us.

1433
01:23:08,192 --> 01:23:09,192
Come in.

1434
01:23:14,025 --> 01:23:15,025
Good morning.

1435
01:23:19,984 --> 01:23:22,150
He's in his study at the end of the hall.

1436
01:23:22,734 --> 01:23:23,984
Can I get anyone coffee?

1437
01:23:24,067 --> 01:23:26,359
I tell you what, ma'am.
That sounds great.

1438
01:23:26,442 --> 01:23:27,775
Nothing for me. Thank you.

1439
01:23:28,609 --> 01:23:30,192
At the end of the hall.

1440
01:23:31,150 --> 01:23:32,359
Mr. Hayden?

1441
01:23:33,525 --> 01:23:36,734
I read in the paper you were
the only one who stood for the judge

1442
01:23:36,817 --> 01:23:38,400
after what he did to Bobby.

1443
01:23:40,109 --> 01:23:43,484
Uh, that was a mistake.
It was just a reflex.

1444
01:23:43,567 --> 01:23:44,567
Tom?

1445
01:23:55,734 --> 01:23:56,734
Hey, Bill.

1446
01:23:58,400 --> 01:23:59,567
Ramsey Clark.

1447
01:24:00,442 --> 01:24:01,775
Pleased to meet you, sir.

1448
01:24:03,067 --> 01:24:05,234
This is Leonard Weinglass.

1449
01:24:05,317 --> 01:24:07,567
- Mr. Weinglass.
- And Tom Hayden.

1450
01:24:07,650 --> 01:24:09,192
Oh, I know who Tom Hayden is.

1451
01:24:09,275 --> 01:24:11,525
The FBI used to work for me.

1452
01:24:12,775 --> 01:24:16,317
Those two men, they're senior deputies
with the Justice Department.

1453
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:17,734
Mr. Kelly and Mr. Ackerman.

1454
01:24:19,150 --> 01:24:22,067
- I don't know why these men are here.
- I invited them.

1455
01:24:22,650 --> 01:24:23,525
You invited them?

1456
01:24:23,609 --> 01:24:26,150
I don't want
the appearance of impropriety.

1457
01:24:26,234 --> 01:24:27,734
There isn't any impropriety.

1458
01:24:27,817 --> 01:24:30,025
And now there are witnesses to that.

1459
01:24:30,109 --> 01:24:34,859
Sir, these men are gonna call
Schultz and Foran as soon as we're done.

1460
01:24:34,942 --> 01:24:38,234
Don't be ridiculous.
They already called Schultz and Foran.

1461
01:24:38,317 --> 01:24:41,484
And they're gonna call John Mitchell
as soon as we're done here.

1462
01:24:42,109 --> 01:24:43,775
Go ahead, ask what you wanna ask.

1463
01:24:45,067 --> 01:24:47,400
- In front of them?
- Yeah.

1464
01:24:51,234 --> 01:24:52,234
All right.

1465
01:24:53,192 --> 01:24:57,359
Mr. Clark, while you were
attorney general for President Johnson

1466
01:24:57,442 --> 01:24:59,609
was there ever any discussion
with the White House

1467
01:24:59,692 --> 01:25:01,859
about seeking indictments
against my clients?

1468
01:25:01,942 --> 01:25:03,775
- He can't answer that.
- Why not?

1469
01:25:03,859 --> 01:25:04,859
It's against the law.

1470
01:25:04,942 --> 01:25:08,025
That's an overly broad
interpretation of the law.

1471
01:25:08,109 --> 01:25:09,984
- If you'd like--
- I'll tell you what.

1472
01:25:10,067 --> 01:25:12,275
We've dealt with
jury tampering, wiretapping,

1473
01:25:12,359 --> 01:25:14,525
a defendant that was literally gagged,

1474
01:25:14,609 --> 01:25:17,275
and a judge who's been
handing down rulings from the bench

1475
01:25:17,359 --> 01:25:19,609
that would be
considered wrong in Honduras.

1476
01:25:19,692 --> 01:25:23,900
So I'm a little less interested in the law
than I was when this trial began.

1477
01:25:23,984 --> 01:25:29,359
Well, whether you like the law or not,
as former AG, he is protected by it.

1478
01:25:29,442 --> 01:25:31,150
No, you are protected by it.

1479
01:25:32,150 --> 01:25:34,817
And with respect, sir, I can subpoena you.

1480
01:25:34,900 --> 01:25:37,734
Find a judge in this circuit
who will sign that subpoena.

1481
01:25:37,817 --> 01:25:41,567
He's right. And taking the stand
voluntarily would be a big risk for me.

1482
01:25:42,150 --> 01:25:43,900
Well, again, with due respect, sir,

1483
01:25:43,984 --> 01:25:47,359
my clients take
a much bigger risk when they...

1484
01:25:48,067 --> 01:25:50,984
- stand against an enormous power...
- What took you so long?

1485
01:25:51,067 --> 01:25:53,692
...that they can't even see, and that...

1486
01:25:54,650 --> 01:25:57,067
I'm sorry.
What took me so long to do what?

1487
01:25:57,150 --> 01:25:59,109
To realize I'm your star witness.

1488
01:26:02,025 --> 01:26:04,692
- We were remarking upon that ourselves--
- Bill...

1489
01:26:04,775 --> 01:26:05,984
He can't testify.

1490
01:26:06,067 --> 01:26:08,442
I'm in private practice now.

1491
01:26:08,525 --> 01:26:11,192
And if John Mitchell
wants to cut me in half,

1492
01:26:11,275 --> 01:26:12,900
he can and he will.

1493
01:26:12,984 --> 01:26:14,484
You have to find some...

1494
01:26:15,734 --> 01:26:17,900
Sir, you have to find some courage now...

1495
01:26:19,192 --> 01:26:21,942
- And--
- Find some courage? Yeah.

1496
01:26:22,025 --> 01:26:24,692
Yes.
You have to find some courage and--

1497
01:26:24,775 --> 01:26:25,775
Tom.

1498
01:26:29,567 --> 01:26:32,025
That's what those two men came to tell me,

1499
01:26:32,109 --> 01:26:36,067
that if John Mitchell wants to
cut me in half, he can and he will.

1500
01:26:36,650 --> 01:26:40,817
So I wanted them in the room when I said,

1501
01:26:41,692 --> 01:26:43,025
"When do you want me in court?"

1502
01:26:45,817 --> 01:26:46,942
Mr. Clark?

1503
01:26:47,567 --> 01:26:48,567
I'm sorry?

1504
01:26:49,109 --> 01:26:50,442
Swear me in, Bill.

1505
01:26:50,525 --> 01:26:54,984
It is against the law for you to testify,
Ramsey. It is as simple as that.

1506
01:26:55,775 --> 01:26:57,067
It's General Clark.

1507
01:26:57,775 --> 01:26:59,942
And arrest me or shut the fuck up.

1508
01:27:05,317 --> 01:27:06,359
Found some.

1509
01:27:08,484 --> 01:27:11,025
Your Honor, the People move
to disallow this witness.

1510
01:27:11,109 --> 01:27:14,067
I'm sure the defense anticipated that.

1511
01:27:14,150 --> 01:27:16,109
Code of federal regulations mandates

1512
01:27:16,192 --> 01:27:18,484
the disclosure
of Justice Department materials

1513
01:27:18,567 --> 01:27:21,609
is prohibited without prior knowledge
of the attorney general,

1514
01:27:21,692 --> 01:27:24,650
plainly meaning
the sitting attorney general,

1515
01:27:24,734 --> 01:27:27,567
who is John Mitchell,
who has denied his approval.

1516
01:27:27,650 --> 01:27:32,525
Judge, the rule refers only to
very specific documents and information.

1517
01:27:32,609 --> 01:27:36,317
If the regulation were interpreted
as Mr. Schultz is asking it to be,

1518
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:38,234
nobody in the federal government

1519
01:27:38,317 --> 01:27:41,734
could ever testify in any trial
after they left their job.

1520
01:27:43,859 --> 01:27:46,567
I think the government
is at least justified

1521
01:27:46,650 --> 01:27:50,150
in asking the defense
to demonstrate, by voir dire,

1522
01:27:50,234 --> 01:27:53,067
the testimony it expects
to elicit from the witness.

1523
01:27:53,150 --> 01:27:56,900
You'd like us to question the witness,
this witness,

1524
01:27:56,984 --> 01:27:59,817
outside the presence of the jury?

1525
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:04,400
If I find any of the testimony relevant,
I'll call the jury back in to hear it.

1526
01:28:05,359 --> 01:28:07,067
Take it or leave it, Mr. Kunstler.

1527
01:28:10,442 --> 01:28:12,734
Defense calls Ramsey Clark.

1528
01:28:25,817 --> 01:28:26,900
State your name.

1529
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:30,609
- William Ramsey Clark.
- Do you swear the testimony you give

1530
01:28:30,692 --> 01:28:33,234
will be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?

1531
01:28:33,317 --> 01:28:34,317
I do.

1532
01:28:37,275 --> 01:28:42,692
Mr. Clark, what was your occupation
in the summer of 1968?

1533
01:28:42,775 --> 01:28:45,150
I was the attorney general
of the United States.

1534
01:28:45,234 --> 01:28:47,775
- You were appointed by President Johnson?
- Yes.

1535
01:28:47,859 --> 01:28:51,192
- Confirmed by the United States Senate.
- Yes.

1536
01:28:51,275 --> 01:28:56,525
Now, did you receive a phone call
at your office at 11:50 a.m.,

1537
01:28:56,609 --> 01:28:59,025
on September 10th of last year?

1538
01:28:59,109 --> 01:28:59,942
Yes.

1539
01:29:00,025 --> 01:29:02,192
- And from whom was that call?
- President Johnson.

1540
01:29:02,275 --> 01:29:07,734
Will you state what President Johnson
said to you and what was said to him?

1541
01:29:07,817 --> 01:29:10,109
Your Honor, at this point, we will object.

1542
01:29:10,192 --> 01:29:13,859
A cabinet officer does not have to,
and should not have to relate the contents

1543
01:29:13,942 --> 01:29:17,234
of a private call he had
with the president.

1544
01:29:17,317 --> 01:29:18,984
I'll sustain the objection.

1545
01:29:19,067 --> 01:29:22,442
Please, the court...
This is voir dire.

1546
01:29:22,525 --> 01:29:25,150
I thought objections were reserved.

1547
01:29:25,234 --> 01:29:28,275
There's a question of
attorney-client privilege to consider.

1548
01:29:28,359 --> 01:29:31,192
The president isn't a client
of the attorney general.

1549
01:29:34,859 --> 01:29:36,109
Excuse me, sir?

1550
01:29:36,692 --> 01:29:39,734
The president isn't a client
of the attorney general.

1551
01:29:39,817 --> 01:29:40,817
I'm happy to answer.

1552
01:29:40,900 --> 01:29:42,359
Your Honor...

1553
01:29:44,359 --> 01:29:47,817
Hearing from the witness
on this point is highly irregular.

1554
01:29:49,025 --> 01:29:51,817
Well, gentlemen, um...

1555
01:29:53,567 --> 01:29:55,067
This is my courtroom.

1556
01:29:55,817 --> 01:29:59,484
But the witness is the former, uh...

1557
01:29:59,567 --> 01:30:03,150
He's just stated
his willingness, you know,

1558
01:30:03,234 --> 01:30:07,275
so, for the purposes of voir dire,
I'll hear the answer.

1559
01:30:08,317 --> 01:30:09,317
Thank you.

1560
01:30:09,942 --> 01:30:15,525
Mr. Clark, uh, did President Johnson
ask you a question in that phone call?

1561
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:19,984
The president asked me
if I intended to seek any indictments

1562
01:30:20,067 --> 01:30:23,484
related to the riots
the previous month in Chicago.

1563
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:25,900
And what did you tell him?

1564
01:30:25,984 --> 01:30:28,567
I told him we wouldn't be
seeking indictments.

1565
01:30:28,650 --> 01:30:30,192
And can you tell us why?

1566
01:30:30,275 --> 01:30:34,692
An investigation by our criminal division
led to the conclusion

1567
01:30:34,775 --> 01:30:37,484
that the riots were started
by the Chicago Police Department.

1568
01:30:52,734 --> 01:30:56,317
And, Mr. Clark,
did your counterintelligence division

1569
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:57,984
make a report as well?

1570
01:30:58,067 --> 01:31:01,942
They concluded that there was
no conspiracy by the defendants

1571
01:31:02,025 --> 01:31:04,942
to incite violence during the convention.

1572
01:31:05,025 --> 01:31:07,234
And then what happened
on the first Tuesday,

1573
01:31:07,317 --> 01:31:09,859
after the first Monday,
in November of that year?

1574
01:31:09,942 --> 01:31:12,359
- Richard Nixon was elected president.
- Sustained.

1575
01:31:12,442 --> 01:31:14,317
- Nobody objected--
- We do.

1576
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:16,984
It's well-known there's no love lost
between the witness

1577
01:31:17,067 --> 01:31:18,609
and the sitting attorney general.

1578
01:31:18,692 --> 01:31:21,067
This witness was called to wage
a political attack

1579
01:31:21,150 --> 01:31:23,234
and should not be allowed before the jury.

1580
01:31:23,317 --> 01:31:24,150
Mr. Kunstler.

1581
01:31:24,234 --> 01:31:26,525
Your Honor, you cannot
possibly be considering

1582
01:31:26,609 --> 01:31:29,900
not allowing the jury to hear
what we've just heard?

1583
01:31:29,984 --> 01:31:32,025
The witness can't present them testimony

1584
01:31:32,109 --> 01:31:34,900
that would assist in making
a determination of guilt or innocence.

1585
01:31:34,984 --> 01:31:38,484
He just testified his own Justice
Department came to the conclusion--

1586
01:31:38,567 --> 01:31:40,150
The current Justice Department,

1587
01:31:40,234 --> 01:31:42,275
the one that matters,
came to a new conclusion.

1588
01:31:42,359 --> 01:31:46,150
Therefore, motivation of the prosecution
has to be called into question.

1589
01:31:46,234 --> 01:31:49,734
The motivation of the prosecution
is not an issue in a courtroom.

1590
01:31:49,817 --> 01:31:53,734
In any courtroom I've ever been in,
except this one.

1591
01:31:53,817 --> 01:31:54,817
Object.

1592
01:31:54,900 --> 01:31:57,442
Mr. Kunstler, do you have
any further examination

1593
01:31:57,525 --> 01:32:01,567
that will demonstrate that this witness
will make a material contribution,

1594
01:32:01,650 --> 01:32:04,275
or should I just ask him to step down?

1595
01:32:04,359 --> 01:32:06,359
You've ruled.

1596
01:32:10,234 --> 01:32:13,442
You're not gonna let the jury
hear his testimony.

1597
01:32:13,525 --> 01:32:16,025
Not unless you can demonstrate to me,

1598
01:32:16,109 --> 01:32:18,817
which you have not thus far done,
that this witness--

1599
01:32:18,900 --> 01:32:22,025
- Are you any good?
- Are you addressing the court reporter?

1600
01:32:22,109 --> 01:32:23,567
- Keep up with us.
- Mr. Kunstler--

1601
01:32:23,650 --> 01:32:25,359
Is this prosecution politically motivated?

1602
01:32:25,442 --> 01:32:26,942
- Object!
- Yes.

1603
01:32:27,025 --> 01:32:29,109
President Nixon inherited
an unpopular war.

1604
01:32:29,192 --> 01:32:30,442
- Yes.
- Step down, Mr. Clark.

1605
01:32:30,525 --> 01:32:32,859
And your clients make it
more unpopular every day.

1606
01:32:32,942 --> 01:32:37,609
This administration is paranoid
about the SDS, the Mobe, the New Left...

1607
01:32:37,692 --> 01:32:39,650
Mr. Clark, please.

1608
01:32:40,359 --> 01:32:44,775
Please, sir. I will be forced
to find you in contempt.

1609
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:46,609
Do you understand?

1610
01:32:49,234 --> 01:32:50,234
I do, Your Honor.

1611
01:32:50,692 --> 01:32:52,609
Then step down, please.

1612
01:32:56,275 --> 01:32:57,442
Thank you, sir.

1613
01:33:06,609 --> 01:33:08,359
Just get to work on the appeal.

1614
01:33:18,525 --> 01:33:21,234
Your Honor, when the jury returns,

1615
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:26,234
will they be informed
that the defense had called

1616
01:33:26,317 --> 01:33:29,400
the former attorney general
of the United States of America,

1617
01:33:29,484 --> 01:33:33,234
but this court ruled
that he couldn't testify?

1618
01:33:34,025 --> 01:33:36,234
No, that motion will be denied.

1619
01:33:56,025 --> 01:33:59,567
Cite Mr. Kunstler
with his third count of contempt.

1620
01:34:05,859 --> 01:34:07,109
You're a thug.

1621
01:34:07,192 --> 01:34:09,400
Did one of the defendants speak?

1622
01:34:09,484 --> 01:34:13,275
I did. I said you're a thug,
because you are.

1623
01:34:13,359 --> 01:34:15,109
- Dave.
- Please sit, Mr. Dellinger.

1624
01:34:15,192 --> 01:34:17,650
- If we're guilty, why not give us a trial?
- Dave.

1625
01:34:17,734 --> 01:34:19,359
Marshals, seat the defendant.

1626
01:34:19,442 --> 01:34:22,734
If we're guilty,
which you have clearly decided--

1627
01:34:22,817 --> 01:34:24,317
- Dave, I've got--
- Watch yourself.

1628
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:26,692
You've clearly decided
that we were, why not--

1629
01:34:26,775 --> 01:34:29,317
No. You don't...
No, you don't need to grab my arm.

1630
01:34:32,984 --> 01:34:34,942
If we're guilty,
why not give us a trial?

1631
01:34:35,025 --> 01:34:38,525
I mean, I have sat here for six months
and watched you!

1632
01:34:38,609 --> 01:34:40,942
You don't need to grab my arm.

1633
01:34:41,025 --> 01:34:43,234
I have watched you.
I've watched you--

1634
01:34:43,317 --> 01:34:44,317
Sir--

1635
01:34:47,150 --> 01:34:49,525
It's okay.
He would not hurt a fly.

1636
01:34:49,609 --> 01:34:51,192
Take him out of here.
Lock him up.

1637
01:34:54,650 --> 01:34:55,859
I hit him.

1638
01:34:57,609 --> 01:34:58,859
I'm sorry.

1639
01:35:08,025 --> 01:35:09,067
I'm sorry.

1640
01:35:42,942 --> 01:35:45,775
There's only one thing.
There's one thing to do.

1641
01:35:46,484 --> 01:35:47,859
Solidarity with Dave.

1642
01:35:49,567 --> 01:35:52,275
Tomorrow, we go into court
and get ourselves arrested.

1643
01:35:53,192 --> 01:35:54,525
We're already arrested.

1644
01:35:55,234 --> 01:35:57,525
Is Bill talking to you
about taking the stand?

1645
01:35:58,150 --> 01:36:01,025
The press guys are saying
Bill's been talking to you about it.

1646
01:36:01,109 --> 01:36:02,442
He's been talking about it.

1647
01:36:02,525 --> 01:36:05,817
He thinks you might get the crowd
worked up with a position paper?

1648
01:36:05,900 --> 01:36:09,400
Maybe he thinks I won't try
to get the crowd worked up at all.

1649
01:36:09,984 --> 01:36:13,650
Maybe he thinks there are jurors
who relied on the safety of the police

1650
01:36:13,734 --> 01:36:15,900
and are put off
when someone calls them pigs,

1651
01:36:15,984 --> 01:36:18,400
or maybe he wants a witness
who dresses like a grown man.

1652
01:36:18,484 --> 01:36:24,025
The cops in this city
in the summer of 1968 were pigs.

1653
01:36:24,609 --> 01:36:26,734
I wonder how many of them
had kids in Vietnam.

1654
01:36:28,609 --> 01:36:30,442
He's gonna take the stand, not you?

1655
01:36:30,525 --> 01:36:32,275
And we're okay with that?

1656
01:36:33,900 --> 01:36:34,734
Abbie?

1657
01:36:34,817 --> 01:36:37,692
What did you mean,
the last thing I want is to end the war?

1658
01:36:38,275 --> 01:36:39,150
What?

1659
01:36:39,234 --> 01:36:43,359
Centuries ago when the trial started,
you said, why did I come to Chicago?

1660
01:36:43,442 --> 01:36:45,484
And I said, "To end the war."

1661
01:36:45,567 --> 01:36:48,317
And then you turned to everyone
and you said,

1662
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:51,484
"The last thing he wants
is to end the war."

1663
01:36:53,609 --> 01:36:54,942
What did you mean by that?

1664
01:36:55,484 --> 01:36:57,484
That you're making the most
of your close-up.

1665
01:36:57,567 --> 01:36:58,650
Yeah...

1666
01:36:58,734 --> 01:37:01,275
- No more war, no Abbie Hoffman.
- What's your problem with me?

1667
01:37:01,859 --> 01:37:03,859
I wish people would stop asking me that.

1668
01:37:03,942 --> 01:37:06,067
- Dave wouldn't want us to--
- Answer it.

1669
01:37:06,150 --> 01:37:07,234
One time.

1670
01:37:08,025 --> 01:37:12,734
All right. My problem
is that for the next 50 years

1671
01:37:12,817 --> 01:37:15,942
when people think of progressive politics,
they're gonna think of you.

1672
01:37:16,025 --> 01:37:18,775
They're gonna think of you
and your idiot followers

1673
01:37:18,859 --> 01:37:22,400
passing out daisies to soldiers
and trying to levitate the Pentagon.

1674
01:37:22,484 --> 01:37:25,442
So they're not gonna think
of equality or justice,

1675
01:37:25,525 --> 01:37:29,067
they're not gonna think
of education or poverty or progress.

1676
01:37:29,150 --> 01:37:31,942
They're gonna think
of a bunch of stoned, lost,

1677
01:37:32,025 --> 01:37:35,567
disrespectful, foul-mouthed,
lawless losers,

1678
01:37:36,150 --> 01:37:37,734
and so we'll lose elections.

1679
01:37:38,817 --> 01:37:39,817
All because of me?

1680
01:37:40,692 --> 01:37:41,525
Yeah.

1681
01:37:41,609 --> 01:37:44,317
Winning elections is the first thing
on your wish list?

1682
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:48,484
Equality, justice, education, poverty
and progress, they're second?

1683
01:37:49,067 --> 01:37:52,400
If you don't win elections,
it doesn't matter what's second.

1684
01:37:52,942 --> 01:37:57,025
And it is astonishing to me that
someone still has to explain that to you.

1685
01:37:57,109 --> 01:37:58,109
Okay.

1686
01:37:58,817 --> 01:38:01,400
Okay, so, uh, Jerry was
talking about standing--

1687
01:38:01,484 --> 01:38:02,692
We don't have any money.

1688
01:38:02,775 --> 01:38:03,984
I'm sorry, what?

1689
01:38:04,067 --> 01:38:05,567
We don't have any money.

1690
01:38:06,484 --> 01:38:09,817
So I stage stunts, and cameras come
and microphones come,

1691
01:38:09,900 --> 01:38:13,567
and it's astonishing that someone
still has to explain that to you.

1692
01:38:13,650 --> 01:38:16,192
You're trading a cow for magic beans.

1693
01:38:16,275 --> 01:38:17,859
That ended up working.

1694
01:38:17,942 --> 01:38:19,067
What?

1695
01:38:19,150 --> 01:38:21,942
The magic beans.
There was a giant up there.

1696
01:38:22,025 --> 01:38:23,025
Oh, for fuck's--

1697
01:38:23,900 --> 01:38:27,317
I can't remember what happened after that.
The little boy may have gotten eaten--

1698
01:38:27,400 --> 01:38:29,109
The giant turned out to be nice.

1699
01:38:29,192 --> 01:38:31,192
- Are you sure?
- No.

1700
01:38:31,275 --> 01:38:33,900
It's hard to believe the seven of us
weren't able to end a war.

1701
01:38:33,984 --> 01:38:35,109
Let me ask you something...

1702
01:38:35,192 --> 01:38:36,442
You guys should shake hands.

1703
01:38:36,525 --> 01:38:39,859
Think Chicago would've gone differently
if Kennedy got the nomination?

1704
01:38:39,942 --> 01:38:41,484
Do I...

1705
01:38:41,567 --> 01:38:42,984
- Just...
- Yeah.

1706
01:38:43,609 --> 01:38:46,692
Yes, I do. I think the Irish guys
would have sat down with Daley,

1707
01:38:46,775 --> 01:38:47,859
and... Yes.

1708
01:38:47,942 --> 01:38:49,734
- I think so too.
- Yeah?

1709
01:38:49,817 --> 01:38:51,025
That's why I was wondering.

1710
01:38:51,942 --> 01:38:54,192
Weren't you just a little bit happy

1711
01:38:54,275 --> 01:38:57,067
when the bullet ripped through his head?

1712
01:38:57,900 --> 01:39:01,067
No Chicago, no Tom Hayden.

1713
01:39:01,859 --> 01:39:04,650
I was one of the pallbearers,
you fucking animal!

1714
01:39:04,734 --> 01:39:08,234
That's right, we're not goin' to jail
because of what we did,

1715
01:39:08,317 --> 01:39:10,067
we're goin' to jail because of who we are!

1716
01:39:10,150 --> 01:39:13,650
Think about that the next time
you shrug off cultural revolution.

1717
01:39:15,359 --> 01:39:18,025
We define winning differently, you and I.

1718
01:39:20,817 --> 01:39:22,525
Bill, you should've seen it.

1719
01:39:22,609 --> 01:39:26,109
Tom tried to beat me up, but through
sheer force of intellectual superiority--

1720
01:39:26,192 --> 01:39:29,067
Stop talking. Just stop talking.

1721
01:39:29,859 --> 01:39:32,942
Foran's office turned this over tonight.

1722
01:39:33,025 --> 01:39:34,234
In discovery.

1723
01:39:35,192 --> 01:39:37,525
It was given to them
by somebody in the crowd.

1724
01:39:37,609 --> 01:39:40,234
No foul play, there are affidavits.

1725
01:39:40,984 --> 01:39:42,900
They really did just get this.

1726
01:39:42,984 --> 01:39:43,984
What's on the tape?

1727
01:39:44,067 --> 01:39:47,025
The sound of you
starting the Chicago riot.

1728
01:39:49,317 --> 01:39:50,317
Hey. What?

1729
01:39:52,817 --> 01:39:56,067
Somebody had a tape recorder
by the bandshell. They got you saying it.

1730
01:39:56,150 --> 01:39:58,942
It's a clear tape.
You can't take the stand.

1731
01:39:59,025 --> 01:40:00,665
- I can handle Schultz and the tape.
- No.

1732
01:40:00,692 --> 01:40:02,317
They'll play the tape anyway, right?

1733
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:05,400
If you take the stand, they'll make you
answer for it, and you can't.

1734
01:40:06,275 --> 01:40:09,442
- They'd just cracked Rennie's head open.
- So you started a riot.

1735
01:40:09,525 --> 01:40:11,442
- Defense rests.
- They had just cracked--

1736
01:40:11,525 --> 01:40:13,650
- If blood is gonna flow...
- Bill...

1737
01:40:13,734 --> 01:40:15,525
...let it flow all over the city.

1738
01:40:15,609 --> 01:40:18,317
- They'd just clubbed Rennie.
- Everybody kept their cool.

1739
01:40:18,400 --> 01:40:21,609
Abbie, Dave...
Shit, this guy kept his cool.

1740
01:40:21,692 --> 01:40:23,150
You're the one who lost it.

1741
01:40:23,234 --> 01:40:24,692
I can take the stand.

1742
01:40:25,442 --> 01:40:28,359
You wanna hear what cross
from Schultz will sound like?

1743
01:40:28,442 --> 01:40:30,775
Sure. I'll show you
what my answers will sound like.

1744
01:40:30,859 --> 01:40:34,400
They called him a radical,
they called him a criminal!

1745
01:40:35,067 --> 01:40:37,942
They called him "Un-American."

1746
01:40:38,025 --> 01:40:41,275
First of all, it turned out the guy
climbing the flagpole was a kid.

1747
01:40:41,359 --> 01:40:44,734
It seems like you guys attract
an awful lot of underage minors.

1748
01:40:44,817 --> 01:40:46,734
- Do you wanna object?
- Objection.

1749
01:40:46,817 --> 01:40:48,650
- Overruled.
- We attract the people

1750
01:40:48,734 --> 01:40:51,025
who have the most to lose
by this war continuing.

1751
01:40:51,109 --> 01:40:53,025
I'm glad you brought that up.
Did you serve?

1752
01:40:53,109 --> 01:40:55,775
I wasn't drafted.
I didn't try to evade the...

1753
01:40:55,859 --> 01:40:58,734
- I had a high number.
- High number? But you didn't enlist?

1754
01:40:58,817 --> 01:41:01,150
I did not volunteer
to kill Vietnamese people, no.

1755
01:41:01,234 --> 01:41:05,359
You testified you saw at least
six policemen start to go after the man...

1756
01:41:05,442 --> 01:41:08,067
Sorry, the kid
who was climbing the flagpole?

1757
01:41:08,150 --> 01:41:09,400
- Yes.
- It was dark.

1758
01:41:09,484 --> 01:41:12,650
You were 100 yards away.
What do you have, telescopic night-vision?

1759
01:41:12,734 --> 01:41:13,984
There were floodlights.

1760
01:41:14,067 --> 01:41:18,192
And when they called him
anti-American, he said, "No,

1761
01:41:18,275 --> 01:41:24,025
that ignominious distinction goes
to those who mouth America's values

1762
01:41:24,900 --> 01:41:27,192
while breaking America's heart."

1763
01:41:29,025 --> 01:41:31,067
I'd like to introduce you now

1764
01:41:31,150 --> 01:41:33,025
to Carl Oglesby of the SDS!

1765
01:41:33,109 --> 01:41:34,817
Come on!

1766
01:41:36,275 --> 01:41:39,025
Hey, it's all right. He's a kid.
We'll get him down.

1767
01:41:41,734 --> 01:41:43,984
Isn't it great to be here in Chicago!

1768
01:41:47,817 --> 01:41:49,942
Come here.
Son of a bitch!

1769
01:41:50,025 --> 01:41:51,317
Hey, leave the kid alone!

1770
01:41:52,317 --> 01:41:53,859
- Hold him!
- Hey!

1771
01:41:53,942 --> 01:41:55,400
Jesus! What is wrong with...

1772
01:41:55,484 --> 01:41:57,484
Rennie was trying
to get the police off of the kid.

1773
01:41:57,567 --> 01:41:59,025
"Get the police off of the kid."

1774
01:41:59,109 --> 01:42:00,025
- Yes.
- How?

1775
01:42:00,109 --> 01:42:01,817
- He was--
- Grabbing them?

1776
01:42:01,900 --> 01:42:04,234
Get off of him! Hey! Get the--

1777
01:42:04,317 --> 01:42:07,609
I'd like to say to the cops back there
that we're allowed to be here.

1778
01:42:07,692 --> 01:42:10,109
- We have permits for this.
- And out of nowhere...

1779
01:42:12,317 --> 01:42:15,775
It was six armed police officers versus
Rennie and a pocket protector.

1780
01:42:15,859 --> 01:42:17,400
I can understand that response.

1781
01:42:17,484 --> 01:42:19,525
How about your response? Let's press play.

1782
01:42:20,025 --> 01:42:21,484
We're gonna need medics...

1783
01:42:21,567 --> 01:42:23,442
The whole world is watching.

1784
01:42:23,525 --> 01:42:27,025
The whole world is watching!

1785
01:42:27,525 --> 01:42:29,109
They've just beaten Rennie, Dave.

1786
01:42:29,192 --> 01:42:31,859
Listen. We can still get
everyone out of here safely.

1787
01:42:31,942 --> 01:42:33,234
No, we can't.

1788
01:42:33,317 --> 01:42:36,734
The whole world is watching!

1789
01:42:36,817 --> 01:42:38,609
The whole world is watching!

1790
01:42:39,109 --> 01:42:42,317
Dellinger tried to stop you from saying
what you were about to say.

1791
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:43,775
Tell them to stay calm.

1792
01:42:45,609 --> 01:42:47,484
- No.
- The whole world is watching!

1793
01:42:47,567 --> 01:42:49,817
- Tom?
- Did you tell 'em to stay calm?

1794
01:42:49,900 --> 01:42:54,942
Wait, Rennie Davis has just been
beaten by the police.

1795
01:42:55,025 --> 01:42:58,484
Rennie's skull has been cracked open.

1796
01:42:58,567 --> 01:43:01,067
- Did you tell your crowd to stay calm--
- Bill--

1797
01:43:01,150 --> 01:43:04,359
I'm Richard Schultz, Tom.
And John Mitchell told me to win.

1798
01:43:04,442 --> 01:43:06,734
Did you tell your crowd
to stay calm or--

1799
01:43:06,817 --> 01:43:08,525
Yes. If blood is gonna flow...

1800
01:43:08,609 --> 01:43:10,900
...let it flow all over the city!

1801
01:43:10,984 --> 01:43:13,442
- God damn it! Tom!
- If gas is gonna be used,

1802
01:43:13,525 --> 01:43:15,984
let it come down all over Chicago!

1803
01:43:16,067 --> 01:43:18,900
We're going to the convention!
Let's get on the streets!

1804
01:43:18,984 --> 01:43:20,609
Get on the street!

1805
01:43:21,734 --> 01:43:25,442
"If blood is gonna flow,
let it flow all over the city."

1806
01:43:26,067 --> 01:43:28,942
What was that, an order
to start a peaceful demonstration?

1807
01:43:34,692 --> 01:43:37,609
Once you had a moment to settle down,
did you try and stop people?

1808
01:43:47,942 --> 01:43:50,692
- Fuck you!
- Get off him!

1809
01:43:59,275 --> 01:44:02,317
- You didn't try and stop anyone.
- No.

1810
01:44:02,400 --> 01:44:06,359
The bridges!
Head to the bridges! The bridges!

1811
01:44:06,442 --> 01:44:08,525
You told them to go to the footbridges.

1812
01:44:08,609 --> 01:44:12,192
The ones able to make it out of the park
without getting arrested or maimed.

1813
01:44:12,275 --> 01:44:14,859
And those people,
the ones you sent to the footbridges,

1814
01:44:14,942 --> 01:44:16,984
did they know what was on the other side?

1815
01:44:24,525 --> 01:44:26,692
You are ordered
to turn around immediately.

1816
01:44:26,775 --> 01:44:28,942
All access to the convention was blocked.

1817
01:44:29,025 --> 01:44:31,650
- By an armored division.
- The Illinois National Guard.

1818
01:44:31,734 --> 01:44:32,817
They're the good guys.

1819
01:44:32,900 --> 01:44:35,484
Jeeps fitted with concertina wire
called Daley dozers.

1820
01:44:37,817 --> 01:44:39,692
When did I stop being
one of the good guys?

1821
01:44:39,775 --> 01:44:42,817
Let's find out.
Were glass bottles thrown at the police?

1822
01:44:42,900 --> 01:44:44,317
We want justice!

1823
01:44:45,817 --> 01:44:48,942
No, don't approach! Stay back! Stay...

1824
01:44:49,025 --> 01:44:51,900
Some people threw bottles.
Dave was trying to shut it down.

1825
01:44:51,984 --> 01:44:53,817
We were frustrated.
All three footbridges--

1826
01:44:53,900 --> 01:44:56,692
So you, Abbie, Jerry and 11 others
eluded the police.

1827
01:44:56,775 --> 01:44:59,400
I wouldn't say we eluded them.
We were fleeing from them.

1828
01:44:59,484 --> 01:45:00,942
Found an unguarded bridge...

1829
01:45:05,817 --> 01:45:07,734
Now here's where things got weird.

1830
01:45:07,817 --> 01:45:11,734
You, Abbie, Jerry and 11 others
found the only way to the convention.

1831
01:45:12,484 --> 01:45:15,275
In the lobby of the Hilton,
right next to the convention center,

1832
01:45:15,359 --> 01:45:17,775
is a bar called the Haymarket Tavern.

1833
01:45:17,859 --> 01:45:21,109
The Haymarket Tavern is a watering hole

1834
01:45:21,192 --> 01:45:23,609
for Chicago's political class
and their hookers.

1835
01:45:25,817 --> 01:45:30,192
And the place was packed to watch Humphrey
getting the nomination a mile away.

1836
01:45:30,275 --> 01:45:32,035
From the House of Representatives

1837
01:45:32,067 --> 01:45:34,359
who represents the great state of Ohio,

1838
01:45:34,442 --> 01:45:36,525
representative Wayne Hays to the stage.

1839
01:45:36,609 --> 01:45:38,484
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

1840
01:45:38,567 --> 01:45:41,234
The great state of Ohio,
the Buckeye State--

1841
01:45:41,317 --> 01:45:42,567
The Buckeye State!

1842
01:45:43,484 --> 01:45:47,609
One side of the Haymarket Tavern
is a picture window with smoked glass.

1843
01:45:47,692 --> 01:45:49,900
You can't see inside it from the street.

1844
01:45:50,859 --> 01:45:52,484
You made it through the riot police,

1845
01:45:52,567 --> 01:45:55,650
tear gas, the National Guard,
you're in sight of the convention center.

1846
01:46:01,984 --> 01:46:05,150
- Where we got trapped.
- What's another word for trapped?

1847
01:46:06,234 --> 01:46:08,317
We were trapped
between the window and the police.

1848
01:46:08,400 --> 01:46:09,734
What's another word for trapped?

1849
01:46:12,192 --> 01:46:13,234
Caught, right?

1850
01:46:16,984 --> 01:46:19,859
Inside the bar,
it's like the '60s never happened.

1851
01:46:19,942 --> 01:46:23,359
Outside the bar,
the '60s were being performed

1852
01:46:23,442 --> 01:46:25,234
for anyone who looked out of the window.

1853
01:46:26,025 --> 01:46:27,567
Anyone know what a buckeye is?

1854
01:46:27,650 --> 01:46:28,900
- Buckeye?
- Yeah.

1855
01:46:28,984 --> 01:46:31,359
A buckeye is a nut. A poisonous nut.

1856
01:46:31,442 --> 01:46:32,650
Hey.

1857
01:46:33,317 --> 01:46:35,859
94 votes for Vice President Humphrey.

1858
01:46:35,942 --> 01:46:38,609
Am I the only one who sees
what's going on out there?

1859
01:46:38,692 --> 01:46:42,150
And we see a cop do something
you don't ever wanna see a cop do.

1860
01:46:47,859 --> 01:46:52,859
'60s outside the bar, '50s inside the bar.

1861
01:46:53,567 --> 01:46:56,984
And then, an unnecessary metaphor.

1862
01:46:57,067 --> 01:46:58,067
It's a nut.

1863
01:46:58,692 --> 01:47:00,109
- What?
- A nut!

1864
01:47:02,609 --> 01:47:04,109
Were you resisting arrest?

1865
01:47:04,192 --> 01:47:07,359
- They pushed us through the window!
- You overrun the riot police...

1866
01:47:07,442 --> 01:47:08,942
Which is more than Rennie can say!

1867
01:47:09,025 --> 01:47:13,025
Over 400 people admitted
to area hospitals with severe injuries!

1868
01:47:13,109 --> 01:47:17,900
They had armored vehicles and bayonets!
They took off their name tags and badges!

1869
01:47:17,984 --> 01:47:21,400
We were trying to protest peacefully
at the fucking convention!

1870
01:47:35,692 --> 01:47:37,359
Hands behind your back.

1871
01:47:39,400 --> 01:47:40,442
Yeah.

1872
01:47:42,984 --> 01:47:44,775
Who started the riot, Tom?

1873
01:47:50,984 --> 01:47:51,984
Our...

1874
01:47:53,192 --> 01:47:54,192
What?

1875
01:47:55,984 --> 01:47:56,984
Our...

1876
01:47:58,484 --> 01:47:59,525
Our blood.

1877
01:48:01,067 --> 01:48:03,692
"Our blood."

1878
01:48:04,859 --> 01:48:06,775
"If our blood is gonna flow..."

1879
01:48:07,900 --> 01:48:09,567
You meant to say,

1880
01:48:10,525 --> 01:48:13,984
"If our blood is gonna flow,
then let it flow all over the city."

1881
01:48:14,067 --> 01:48:15,484
You didn't mean the cops.

1882
01:48:15,567 --> 01:48:19,109
You were saying, "If they're gonna
beat us up, everyone should see it."

1883
01:48:24,525 --> 01:48:25,775
Jesus Christ!

1884
01:48:25,859 --> 01:48:28,859
You do this...
He does this, it's a pattern.

1885
01:48:28,942 --> 01:48:31,234
Read his portion
of the Port Huron Statement.

1886
01:48:31,317 --> 01:48:36,234
He implies possessive pronouns
and uses vague noun modifiers.

1887
01:48:38,317 --> 01:48:40,234
You read the Port Huron Statement?

1888
01:48:40,317 --> 01:48:41,984
I've read everything you've published.

1889
01:48:43,984 --> 01:48:44,817
I didn't know that.

1890
01:48:44,900 --> 01:48:46,317
You're a talented guy.

1891
01:48:46,984 --> 01:48:49,275
- Except for the possessive pronouns.
- I know.

1892
01:48:49,359 --> 01:48:50,984
And the vague noun modifiers.

1893
01:49:00,984 --> 01:49:02,567
Put Abbie on the stand instead.

1894
01:49:06,150 --> 01:49:08,984
Would you state your full name
for the record, please?

1895
01:49:09,567 --> 01:49:10,567
It's Abbie.

1896
01:49:11,192 --> 01:49:12,192
Last name.

1897
01:49:12,817 --> 01:49:14,859
My grandfather's name was Shaboysnakoff,

1898
01:49:14,942 --> 01:49:18,025
but he was a Russian Jew
protesting anti-Semitism,

1899
01:49:18,109 --> 01:49:21,275
so he was assigned a name
that would sound like yours.

1900
01:49:22,067 --> 01:49:23,859
What is your date of birth?

1901
01:49:23,942 --> 01:49:26,359
Psychologically, 1960.

1902
01:49:26,442 --> 01:49:29,234
What were you doing until 1960?

1903
01:49:29,317 --> 01:49:32,484
Nothing. I believe it's called
an American education.

1904
01:49:33,775 --> 01:49:36,650
Why don't we just proceed
with the testimony?

1905
01:49:36,734 --> 01:49:37,900
Sure.

1906
01:49:37,984 --> 01:49:40,859
Abbie, do you know
why you're on trial here?

1907
01:49:42,150 --> 01:49:45,025
We carried certain ideas
across state lines.

1908
01:49:46,192 --> 01:49:49,109
Not machine guns
or drugs or little girls.

1909
01:49:49,192 --> 01:49:50,400
Ideas.

1910
01:49:51,442 --> 01:49:54,150
When we crossed from New York
to New Jersey to Pennsylvania

1911
01:49:54,234 --> 01:49:57,775
to Ohio to Illinois, we had certain ideas.

1912
01:49:57,859 --> 01:49:59,192
And for that,

1913
01:50:00,067 --> 01:50:03,359
we were gassed, beaten,
arrested and put on trial.

1914
01:50:03,442 --> 01:50:04,317
Okay.

1915
01:50:04,400 --> 01:50:09,192
In 1861, Lincoln said
in his inaugural address,

1916
01:50:09,942 --> 01:50:12,692
"When the people shall grow weary
of their constitutional right

1917
01:50:12,775 --> 01:50:13,942
to amend their government,

1918
01:50:14,025 --> 01:50:16,609
they shall exert their revolutionary right

1919
01:50:16,692 --> 01:50:20,650
to dismember and overthrow
that government."

1920
01:50:21,567 --> 01:50:25,109
And if Lincoln had given that speech
in Lincoln Park last summer,

1921
01:50:25,192 --> 01:50:27,400
he'd be put on trial with the rest of us.

1922
01:50:27,484 --> 01:50:31,942
So how do you overthrow or dismember,
as you say, your government peacefully?

1923
01:50:32,817 --> 01:50:35,192
In this country,
we do it every four years.

1924
01:50:37,234 --> 01:50:38,275
That's all.

1925
01:50:47,442 --> 01:50:53,067
So Chicago was just
a massive voter registration drive.

1926
01:50:53,150 --> 01:50:55,900
Yeah.

1927
01:50:56,484 --> 01:50:59,067
Did you hear the tape we played
of Tom Hayden?

1928
01:50:59,150 --> 01:51:00,692
- Yes.
- You heard the tape?

1929
01:51:00,775 --> 01:51:03,775
Did you hear Mr. Hayden
give an instruction to his people

1930
01:51:03,859 --> 01:51:05,025
to take to the streets?

1931
01:51:05,109 --> 01:51:09,317
"His people"?
Hayden's not a Mafia don and neither am I.

1932
01:51:09,400 --> 01:51:10,484
Did you hear him say,

1933
01:51:10,567 --> 01:51:13,859
"If blood is gonna flow,
let it flow all over the city"?

1934
01:51:13,942 --> 01:51:17,275
The beginning of that sentence
was supposed to be...

1935
01:51:18,775 --> 01:51:20,234
Yes. Yes, I did.

1936
01:51:21,567 --> 01:51:22,609
What'd you think of that?

1937
01:51:25,609 --> 01:51:28,942
I think Tom Hayden is a badass
of an American patriot.

1938
01:51:30,900 --> 01:51:34,609
I didn't ask what you thought of the man,
I asked of his instruction of the crowd.

1939
01:51:35,234 --> 01:51:38,275
I've also heard Tom Hayden say,
"Let's end the war,"

1940
01:51:38,359 --> 01:51:40,234
but nobody stopped shooting.

1941
01:51:40,900 --> 01:51:44,942
You can do anything to anything
by taking it out of context, Mr. Schultz.

1942
01:51:45,025 --> 01:51:48,900
"If blood is gonna flow"?
How do you take that out of context?

1943
01:51:49,942 --> 01:51:54,900
A guy once said, "I am come to set a man
at variance with his father

1944
01:51:54,984 --> 01:51:58,234
and the daughter against her mother."
You know who said it?

1945
01:51:59,067 --> 01:52:00,067
Jerry Rubin.

1946
01:52:00,109 --> 01:52:01,692
Yes.

1947
01:52:02,359 --> 01:52:03,359
No.

1948
01:52:03,859 --> 01:52:05,317
It was Jesus Christ.

1949
01:52:05,400 --> 01:52:07,400
Matthew 10:35.

1950
01:52:07,484 --> 01:52:10,984
And it sure sounds like
he's telling kids to kill their parents.

1951
01:52:11,734 --> 01:52:15,067
Until you read Matthew 10:34 and 10:36.

1952
01:52:15,942 --> 01:52:16,775
Do you have--

1953
01:52:16,859 --> 01:52:19,775
He'd just seen his best friend
get hit in the head with a nightstick.

1954
01:52:20,567 --> 01:52:23,692
The police, Mr. Schultz,
whose people are they?

1955
01:52:24,275 --> 01:52:26,984
- Do you have contempt for your government?
- Do I--

1956
01:52:27,067 --> 01:52:30,400
Yeah, do you have contempt
for your government?

1957
01:52:31,734 --> 01:52:35,692
I think the institutions of our democracy
are wonderful things

1958
01:52:35,775 --> 01:52:38,775
that right now are populated
by some terrible people.

1959
01:52:38,859 --> 01:52:40,400
Please answer the question.

1960
01:52:41,109 --> 01:52:42,234
Tell me again?

1961
01:52:48,900 --> 01:52:50,609
Do you have contempt for your government?

1962
01:52:51,234 --> 01:52:54,859
I'll tell you, it's nothing compared to
the contempt my government has for me.

1963
01:52:54,942 --> 01:52:58,817
We've heard testimony
from 27 witnesses, under oath,

1964
01:52:58,900 --> 01:53:02,734
that say you hoped
for a confrontation with the police,

1965
01:53:02,817 --> 01:53:06,150
that your plans for the convention
were designed specifically

1966
01:53:06,234 --> 01:53:08,650
to draw the police into a confrontation.

1967
01:53:08,734 --> 01:53:11,609
If I'd known it was gonna be
the first wish of mine that came true,

1968
01:53:11,692 --> 01:53:12,859
I would've aimed higher.

1969
01:53:12,942 --> 01:53:14,984
It's a yes or no question.
When you came to Chicago,

1970
01:53:15,067 --> 01:53:18,567
were you hoping for a confrontation
with the police?

1971
01:53:29,817 --> 01:53:31,525
I'm concerned you have to think about it.

1972
01:53:32,442 --> 01:53:34,109
Give me a moment, would you, friend?

1973
01:53:34,734 --> 01:53:37,359
I've never been on trial
for my thoughts before.

1974
01:54:23,442 --> 01:54:24,650
All rise.

1975
01:54:26,692 --> 01:54:28,734
69 CR 180,

1976
01:54:28,817 --> 01:54:32,150
United States of America
vs. David Dellinger et al.

1977
01:54:42,859 --> 01:54:46,442
The law requires that before sentencing,

1978
01:54:46,525 --> 01:54:51,442
I allow the defendant or defendants
to make a statement to the court.

1979
01:54:51,525 --> 01:54:56,442
I've advised defense counsel
that the court will allow one defendant

1980
01:54:56,525 --> 01:54:59,775
to speak for the group,
and I've been advised

1981
01:54:59,859 --> 01:55:01,775
the group has chosen Mr. Hayden.

1982
01:55:01,859 --> 01:55:04,275
- Is that right?
- Yes, sir.

1983
01:55:04,775 --> 01:55:08,859
Mr. Hayden, in spite of your actions
during the convention,

1984
01:55:09,567 --> 01:55:13,109
you are the one defendant
who has shown, during this trial,

1985
01:55:13,775 --> 01:55:17,859
respect for this court
and for this country,

1986
01:55:17,942 --> 01:55:20,400
and remorse for those actions.

1987
01:55:20,484 --> 01:55:23,275
I truly believe... And I mean this.

1988
01:55:24,609 --> 01:55:30,775
I truly believe that one day you will be
a very productive part of our system.

1989
01:55:31,650 --> 01:55:36,900
I'd like you to make your statement brief
and without political content of any kind.

1990
01:55:37,609 --> 01:55:39,609
If you make your statement brief,

1991
01:55:39,692 --> 01:55:44,359
if you make it respectful, if you make it
remorseful and to the point,

1992
01:55:45,192 --> 01:55:49,150
I will look favorably upon that
when administering my sentence.

1993
01:55:51,275 --> 01:55:53,192
Do you understand what I've just said?

1994
01:55:55,275 --> 01:55:56,359
Mr. Hayden?

- You'll look favorably in sentencing.
- Yes.

1997
01:56:03,650 --> 01:56:07,067
If I make my statement
respectful and remorseful.

Yes.

1999
01:56:11,567 --> 01:56:13,817
I'm sorry, Your Honor,
what was the third one?

Brief.

2002
01:56:19,609 --> 01:56:22,942
If I do these things,
my government will look favorably on me.

2003
01:56:23,025 --> 01:56:24,234
You understand?

2004
01:56:25,234 --> 01:56:26,234
