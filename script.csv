1,LYNDON JOHNSON,"I have today ordered to Vietnam the Air Mobile Division and certain other forces which will raise our fighting strength from 75,000 to 125,000 almost immediately. This will make it necessary to increase our active fighting forces by raising the monthly draft from 17,000 to 35,000 per month."
2,YOUNG MAN,June 3rd. All those whose birthday falls on June 3rd--
3,REPORTER #1,"President Johnson announced new monthly draft totals increasing to 35,000 per month--"
4,REPORTER #2,"43,000 per month--"
5,REPORTER #3,"51,000 per month--"
6,REPORTER #4,"382,386 men between the ages of 18 and 24 have now been called to duty. 2."
7,MARTIN LUTHER KING,It should be incandescently clear that no one who has any concern for the integrity of life in America today can ignore the present war--
8,MARTIN LUTHER KING,"If America's soul becomes poisoned, part of the autopsy must read ""Vietnam”,"
9,ROBERT KENNEDY,"What we need in the United States is not hatred, but love and wisdom. So I ask you to return home and say a prayer for the family of Martin Luther King."
10,YOUNG MAN,April 22nd. All those whose birthday falls on April 22nd--
11,RENNIE,We were there.
12,RENNIE,"We didn't see Vietnamese soldiers. What we saw were population centers. Schoolhouses, pagodas, women and children."
13,RENNIE,And that's American napalm. The women and children were burned alive. Tom?
14,TOM,The Democratic Party is going to nominate Hubert Humphrey next month in Chicago.
15,TOM,"When it comes to the war, when it comes to social justice, there's simply not enough of a difference between Hubert Humphrey and Richard Nixon to make a difference."
16,TOM,And so we're going to Chicago.
17,TOM,Young people by busloads will go to Chicago to show our solidarity and our disgust and most importantly--
18,ABBIE,--to get laid by someone you just met.
19,JERRY,"536,000 of us sent to a country not one of these bumper sticker patriots in Washington could find on a map with a motherfuckin' map!"
20,ABBIE,"We're going to Chicago. Anyone who stays in the park, sings Woody Guthrie, they're gonna be fine. But the cops are gonna be a half-inch from losin' their fuckin' minds 'cause Daley's gonna wind 'em up to make sure of it. We're goin' to Chicago peacefully. We're going peacefully, but if we're met there with violence, you better believe we're gonna meet that violence with- - 5."
21,DAVE,Non-violence. Always non-violence and that's without exception.
22,SON,What if the police start hitting you?
23,DAVE,Why would the police start hitting me?
24,SON,What if they do?
25,DAVE,I'll duck.
26,MRS. DELLINGER,David. He watches the news.
27,DAVE,Why?
28,MRS. DELLINGER,You taught him to!
29,DAVE,Guys. I've organized a hundred protests. This one isn't going to be any different in that it almost certainly won't work. The police--
30,MRS. DELLINGER,I'm not worried about the police. And I'm not worried about Hayden and Rennie Davis. I'm worried about Hoffman and Rubin. 6.
31,DAVE,"It's the Democratic National Convention, honey, every camera in America is gonna be pointed at it and Daley isn't gonna let his city become a theater of war. And Hoffman and Rubin are geniuses...in their own special way."
32,MRS. DELLINGER,Oh Jesus--
33,DAVE,(re the SON) He's got a Scout meeting tonight at 7.
34,SON,Dad--
35,DAVE,"If the police try to arrest me I'll do what I always do and what I've taught you to do, which is what? (beat) Which is what? Tell me, bud."
36,SON,Very calmly and very politely--
37,BOBBY,Fuck the motherfuckers up.
38,BOBBY,"They leave us alone and everything's cool. They tangle, disrupt, intimidate, they play it fast and loose with the First Amendment--"
39,SONDRA,Robert--
40,BOBBY,"--they start breaking heads, then no, we will not be on our way. 7."
41,SONDRA,You can't give this speech in Chicago.
42,BOBBY,Fred Hampton wants me there.
43,SONDRA,Let Fred give the speech.
44,BOBBY,Between Hayden and Hoffman there could be five-thousand people. It'd be nice to talk to five-thousand people.
45,SONDRA,Not while you're in trouble in Connecticut.
46,BOBBY,"Yes while I'm in trouble in--I'm the head of the Black Panthers, Sondra, when the hell am I not gonna be in trouble?!"
47,SONDRA,"You're gonna be in a lot more of it if you stand up and say ""Fry the pigs”!"
48,BOBBY,"""If they attack you”, you're taking it out of context."
49,SONDRA,"So will every white person in America, cops won't give a shit about context and you don't have enough protection in Chicago!"
50,BOBBY,There's no place to be right now but in it.
51,SONDRA,But fry the pigs? 8.
52,BOBBY,"""IF THEY--"
53,SONDRA,Dr. King--
54,BOBBY,"--is dead! He has a dream? Well now he has a fuckin' bullet in his head. Martin's dead. Malcolm's dead. Medgar's dead. Bobby's dead. Jesus is dead. They tried it peaceful. We're gonna try something else. (pause) Sondra, I'll be there for four hours, that's it."
55,SONDRA,You at least gonna take one of these?
56,BOBBY,If I knew how to use that I wouldn't need to make speeches.
57,JERRY,It's named after the Russian Commissar Vyacheslav Mikhailovich Molotov. You start with a glass bottle.
58,JERRY,"You pack the styrofoam, and now your cherry bomb..."
59,JERRY,Some chewing gum around the top.
60,JERRY,And a fuse.
61,STUDENT,Now!
62,TOM,(calling) Is that Jerry? 10.
63,RENNIE,Yeah.
64,TOM,Tell him to tell Abbie that we're going to Chicago to end the war and not to fuck around.
65,RENNIE,(into phone) Tom says to tell Abbie that we're going to Chicago to end the war and not to fuck around.
66,JERRY,Hayden says we're going to Chicago to end the war and not to fuck around.
67,ABBIE,Tell Hayden I went to Brandeis and I can do both.
68,ABBIE,"People say, you know, Abbie, are you concerned about an overreaction from the cops?"
69,DALEY,I have issued by an order to shoot to kill any arsonist or anyone with a Molotov cocktail in his hand. 11.
70,ABBIE,We're not concerned about it.
71,REPORTER #5,"Four units of the Illinois National Guard, totaling 5000 troops, have been deployed to Chicago--"
72,ABBIE,We're counting on it.
73,TOM,"We want to underscore again that we're coming to Chicago peacefully, but whether we're given permits or not, we're coming."
74,REPORTER #6,"An additional 10,000 Chicago police officers, including riot squads--"
75,DAVE,"We are not going to storm the Convention with tanks or mace, but we are going to storm the hearts and minds of the American people. 12."
76,GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL,These people are revolutionaries bent on the destruction of the United States of America.
77,WALTER CRONKITE,A Democratic Convention is about to begin...in a police state. There just doesn't seem to be any other way to say it.
78,SECRETARY,You've arrived at a moment in history. 13.
79,SCHULTZ,(pause) Pardon me?
80,SECRETARY,(pointing) They're changing the picture.
81,HOWARD,Tom.
82,FORAN,Howard.
83,HOWARD,You flew in alright?
84,FORAN,Sure.
85,HOWARD,Richard Schultz?
86,SCHULTZ,Yes sir.
87,HOWARD,"Howard Ackerman, Special Advisor to the Attorney General."
88,SCHULTZ,Pleased to meet you.
89,HOWARD,Were you told what this is about?
90,SCHULTZ,"No sir. Just to meet Mr. Foran at O'Hare this morning, that we were flying to Washington and that we were meeting Mr. Mitchell. 14."
91,HOWARD,Good. (noticing) They're finally changing the goddamn picture. C'mon in.
92,MITCHELL,"As a matter of courtesy and tradition, when we elect a new president, the outgoing cabinet members resign to spare the new president the unpleasantness of firing them. You know when President Nixon received Ramsey Clark's formal letter of resignation?"
93,SCHULTZ,"No, sir."
94,MITCHELL,"About an hour before I was confirmed. That was to embarrass me. I don't know, I think it was more embarrassing for Ramsey Clark. I'm John Mitchell."
95,FORAN,"Thomas Foran, Mr. Attorney General, and this is Richard Schultz."
96,MITCHELL,"Richard, Chicago was more fucked up than any ten things I've ever seen in my life."
97,SCHULTZ,Sir?
98,HOWARD,The convention. The riots.
99,SCHULTZ,Yes sir. 15.
100,SCHULTZ,"Well as a matter of fact, sir, we don't believe any federal laws were broken last summer. Mr. Foran had our office run a thorough investigation. Plenty of trespassing, destruction of public property, lewd behavior I suppose, but--"
101,SCHULTZ,...nothing rising to the level of--
102,MITCHELL,Do you think you and your boss are in the Attorney General's office because I want you to seek an indictment for violating a federal trespassing law?
103,SCHULTZ,"Sir, our office wasn't aware the Justice Department wanted to seek any indictments at all."
104,MITCHELL,We do.
105,SCHULTZ,Ramsey Clark was dead set against bringing federal--
106,MITCHELL,"Ramsey Clark doesn't run the Justice Department anymore, did you hear about that? And Mr. Johnson's back home in Texas."
107,SCHULTZ,"Of course, sir."
108,MITCHELL,"One hour before my confirmation hearing gaveled, that's when he resigned. What a prick."
109,SCHULTZ,"It was unprofessional, sir. 17."
110,MITCHELL,"Unprofessional, it was unpatriotic. And I'll tell you what else--it was impolite. There's such a thing as manners. I want to bring back manners, how 'bout that. The America I grew up in. Will you help me, Mr. Schultz? 'Cause I asked Mr. Foran who was the best prosecutor in his office and he said you."
111,SCHULTZ,Thank you.
112,HOWARD,Section 2101 of Title 18.
113,MITCHELL,That's the federal law that was broken.
114,SCHULTZ,That's the Rap Brown law.
115,HOWARD,Conspiracy to Cross State Lines in Order to Incite Violence. It comes with a ten-year maximum and we want all ten.
116,SCHULTZ,"For whom, sir?"
117,HOWARD,The all-star team.
118,SCHULTZ,"Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, Tom Hayden, Rennie Davis, Dave Dellinger, Lee Weiner, John Froines...and Bobby Seale?"
119,MITCHELL,"I call them the schoolboys, and when I do, everyone here knows who I'm talking about. Petulant and dangerous. (MORE) 18."
120,MITCHELL,"And we've watched for a decade while these rebels without a job who've never bothered to get their hands dirty fighting the enemy tell us how to prosecute a war. The decade's over, the grown-ups are back and I deem these shitty little fairies to be a threat to national security so they're gonna spend their 30's in a federal facility. Real time."
121,FORAN,"You're lead prosecutor, Richard. You understand why I couldn't tell you until we got here."
122,SCHULTZ,Sure. Yes sir.
123,HOWARD,"Richard, you're being given the ball, are you ready to do this?"
124,SCHULTZ,You pay me for my opinion.
125,MITCHELL,What?
126,SCHULTZ,"I said, sir, you pay me for my opinion?"
127,MITCHELL,"Where did you learn that, in class? I pay you to win."
128,SCHULTZ,I'm not sure we can get a good indictment on conspiracy.
129,MITCHELL,Why not?
130,SCHULTZ,"For one thing, some of these people had never met each other."
131,MITCHELL,Telephones. 19.
132,SCHULTZ,(beat) Yes sir.
133,FORAN,(quietly) You didn't show a lot of gratitude in there.
134,SCHULTZ,"(quietly) On top of everything else, we're giving them exactly what they want-- a stage and an audience."
135,FORAN,You really think it's going to be a big audience?
136,CROWD,The whole world is watching! The whole world is watching! The whole world is watching!...
137,SCHULTZ,"Yes sir, I do."
138,ABBIE,You alright?
139,JERRY,I was until I saw this.
140,ABBIE,Most of them are on our side.
141,CROWD MEMBER,"(shouting) We love you, Abbie!"
142,ABBIE,Jesus Christ. How did you do that?
143,JERRY,Experience.
144,ABBIE,"You don't know what to do with the egg now, do you."
145,JERRY,No.
146,KUNSTLER,"Hang on, quiet down please. I want you all to meet a new addition to the defense team, this is Leonard Weinglass, one of this country's most talented First Amendment litigators."
147,REPORTER,"Bill, can you tell us--"
148,KUNSTLER,"(quieting the others) Go ahead, Sy."
149,SY,Can you tell us the status of Charles Garry?
150,KUNSTLER,Charles Garry is still in the hospital and you should contact his office for information. Marjorie.
151,MARJORIE,Does that mean you're representing Bobby Seale today?
152,KUNSTLER,"It's very important that it be understood that for his own protection, I am not acting as Bobby Seale's attorney today. One more. Jack."
153,JACK,"Bill, I was told that it was Hayden who wanted to bring Mr. Weinglass in. That Hayden has concerns about your seriousness."
154,KUNSTLER,Well-- 24.
155,WEINGLASS,"This is William Kunstler. You want to find out how serious he is, meet him at a witness stand."
156,KUNSTLER,"Thank you, ladies and gentlemen."
157,FROINES,Weiner.
158,WEINER,Yeah.
159,FROINES,"I get why they're trying to smoke Abbie and Jerry and Hayden, even Rennie and Dellinger, but for the life of me I can't figure out what the two of us are doing here."
160,WEINER,I feel exactly the same way. But this is the Academy Awards of protest and as far as I'm concerned it's an honor just to be nominated.
161,TOM,What is that? 25.
162,RENNIE,I've been keeping a list every day. Americans who've been killed since the day we were arrested.
163,TOM,Why?
164,RENNIE,With the trial starting it might get easy to forget who this is about.
165,KUNSTLER,Fellas.
166,RENNIE,Good morning.
167,WEINGLASS,Good morning.
168,TOM,Good morning.
169,KUNSTLER,"(quietly to TOM) I just got a question about my seriousness. Whatever's going on between you and Abbie, keep it out of this building."
170,TOM,I just feel like this is gearing up to be--
171,KUNSTLER,Fred. 26.
172,FRED,Bill.
173,KUNSTLER,(quietly) Did you have breakfast this morning?
174,BOBBY,(pause) What?
175,KUNSTLER,Did you have breakfast?
176,BOBBY,I did.
177,KUNSTLER,What'd you have?
178,FRED,What are you doing?
179,KUNSTLER,I'm talking to him about breakfast because that's the only thing I'm allowed to talk to him about.
180,FRED,That's right.
181,KUNSTLER,Bobby--
182,FRED,We have instructions from our lawyer.
183,KUNSTLER,"If you need me I'm sitting right there. You just look at me and say, ""I need you”."
184,FRED,We don't need you.
185,BOBBY,You two gonna be like this? 27.
186,KUNSTLER,"(to BOBBY, re: the African- Americans in the gallery) They shouldn't sit together. The jury's not gonna like that look."
187,BOBBY,"This isn't my jury. And if they don't like the look, they can--"
188,FRED,"No, he's right. (to the group) Spread out, okay? In pairs."
189,KUNSTLER,And Fred?
190,BOBBY,"No, they're dressed just fine."
191,FRED,It's alright. (to the group) Take your very scary hats off. (back to KUNSTLER) Don't mess us up.
192,KUNSTLER,"Alright, good pep talk."
193,ABBIE,You see the crowd out there?
194,JERRY,I have an egg.
195,KUNSTLER,Get rid of that.
196,JERRY,You don't think I want to?
197,ABBIE,"It's like we're, you know, whatshisname, we just met him. 28."
198,JERRY,Yeah.
199,ABBIE,(beat) What is his name?
200,JERRY,Who?
201,ABBIE,The drummer. The greatest drummer ever.
202,JERRY,Gene Krupa?
203,ABBIE,"No, I'm talkin' about--Gene Krupa?-- I'm talkin' about the drummer for Cream, we just met him last night."
204,JERRY,Ginger Baker.
205,ABBIE,"Thank you. The crowd outside is so big it's as if we're Ginger Baker, is what I was trying to say."
206,KUNSTLER,Are you stoned?
207,ABBIE,Yeah. You?
208,KUNSTLER,(quietly) You remember what I said.
209,TOM,"Okay, and you remember to keep us out of prison."
210,KUNSTLER,A lot of good advice this morning.
211,BAILIFF,All rise! 29.
212,BAILIFF,"Hear yea, hear yea. September 26, 1969, 10 o'clock A.M. All persons having business before the United States District Court of Northern Illinois, Southern District, Eastern Division draw near and they shall be heard. Judge Julius Hoffman presiding. God save the United States of America and this Honorable Court."
213,JUDGE HOFFMAN,"Mr. Marshal, bring in our jury."
214,JUDGE HOFFMAN,"As I look out into the gallery I see we have a full house. Some of you started forming a line early this morning. I'll caution you that this isn't a sporting event. Let the record show that we've been joined by our twelve jurors and four alternates. Mrs. Winter, please call the case."
215,MRS. WINTER,"69 CR 180, United States of America vs. David Dellinger, Rennard C. Davis, Thomas Hayden, Abbott Hoffman, Jerry C. Rubin, Lee Weiner, John R. Froines and Bobby G. Seale for trial."
216,JUDGE HOFFMAN,Are the People ready to make opening arguments?
217,SCHULTZ,"(standing) We are, Your Honor."
218,BOBBY,I don't have my lawyer here.
219,JUDGE HOFFMAN,It's not your turn to speak.
220,BOBBY,My trial's begun without my lawyer.
221,JUDGE HOFFMAN,Please sit. Mr. Schultz?
222,SCHULTZ,"Good morning, my name is Richard Schultz and I'm an Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Illinois. Seated at my table is my boss, U.S. Attorney Thomas Foran. I guess you could say I'm seated at his table. At the defense table are the eight defendants represented by their lawyers, William Kunstler and Leonard Weinglass. The defendants would tell you they represent three different groups. They would tell you that one group--"
223,JUDGE HOFFMAN,Excuse me.
224,SCHULTZ,Yes sir.
225,JUDGE HOFFMAN,"I'd like to clarify something for the jurors. There are two Hoffmans in this courtroom. The defendant, Abbie Hoffman, and myself, Judge Julius Hoffman."
226,SCHULTZ,"Thank you, sir."
227,JUDGE HOFFMAN,I didn't want there to be confusion on the matter. 31.
228,ABBIE,"Man, I don't think there's much chance they're going to mix us up."
229,JUDGE HOFFMAN,You will address this Court as Judge or Your Honor and you will not address this Court until--you will not address this Court.
230,SCHULTZ,The defendants would tell you they represent three different groups.
231,JUDGE HOFFMAN,And the record should reflect that defendant Hoffman and I aren't related.
232,ABBIE,Father no!
233,JUDGE HOFFMAN,"Mr. Hoffman, are you familiar with contempt of court?"
234,ABBIE,"It's practically a religion for me, sir."
235,SCHULTZ,(pause) Your Honor?
236,JUDGE HOFFMAN,Continue.
237,SCHULTZ,Rennie Davis and Tom Hayden are the leaders of the SDS--Students for a Democratic Society. Hayden and Davis brought their people to Chicago for the purpose of causing violence in the streets in order to disrupt the Democratic Convention. You know the Youth International Party as the Yippies. Their leaders are Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin. (MORE) 32.
238,SCHULTZ,"Bobby Seale is the leader of the Black Panther Party. The defendants would tell you these are three distinct groups, but they're all--"
239,BOBBY,(standing) Excuse me.
240,JUDGE HOFFMAN,Yes?
241,BOBBY,May I speak?
242,JUDGE HOFFMAN,No sir.
243,BOBBY,He just said my name.
244,JUDGE HOFFMAN,"You're a defendant in this case, you're likely to hear your name."
245,BOBBY,I have a right to counsel and His Honor knows that.
246,JUDGE HOFFMAN,Don't tell the Court what it does and doesn't know. Be seated.
247,JUDGE HOFFMAN,Mr. Schultz.
248,SCHULTZ,"...the radical left, that's all. They're the radical left in different costumes. The eight defendants had a plan. A plan among two or more people is a conspiracy. The defendants crossed state lines to execute their plan, that's why we're in federal court. The plan was to incite a riot. And there's one thing you already know. They succeeded. 33."
249,KUNSTLER,"Sir, it's not a tactic. At the moment, the defendants are the only ones on record as knowing their own names."
250,JUDGE HOFFMAN,"Be seated, Mr. Schultz. (correcting himself) Mr. Kunstler."
251,BOBBY,(standing) I object to being characterized as a member of this group.
252,JUDGE HOFFMAN,Who is your lawyer?
253,BOBBY,Charles R. Garry.
254,JUDGE HOFFMAN,Is Mr. Garry here today?
255,BOBBY,No he's not.
256,KUNSTLER,Your Honor--
257,JUDGE HOFFMAN,Are you representing Mr. Seale?
258,KUNSTLER,No sir.
259,JUDGE HOFFMAN,"Then sit. Mr. Schultz, forgive me, have you concluded your opening statement?"
260,SCHULTZ,"Yes, Your Honor."
261,BOBBY,"My lawyer, Charles Garry, is in a hospital in Oakland having undergone gallbladder surgery. 35."
262,JUDGE HOFFMAN,"Mr. Kunstler, you're sitting right next to the man, just represent him. It's the same case."
263,KUNSTLER,The fact that there's a lawyer near Mr. Seale doesn't satisfy the requirements of due process.
264,BOBBY,I have a right--
265,KUNSTLER,(putting his hand up to BOBBY) A motion was made for postponement due to Mr. Garry's medical condition. I was there. Your Honor denied that motion and therefore Mr. Seale is here without legal representation.
266,JUDGE HOFFMAN,"I don't care for your general tone, Mr. Kunstler."
267,KUNSTLER,"I meant no disrespect to the Court, sir. I'm trying to be clear that I can't muddy Mr. Seale's grounds for appeal by appearing to speak as his lawyer."
268,JUDGE HOFFMAN,"I don't ask you to compromise Mr. Seale's position, sir, but I will not permit him to address the jury with his very competent lawyer seated--"
269,JERRY,"Jesus Christ, for the fourth time, he's not Bobby's lawyer!"
270,JUDGE HOFFMAN,You're Mr. Rubin?
271,JERRY,Yes sir. 36.
272,JUDGE HOFFMAN,Don't ever do that again.
273,BOBBY,"Your Honor, I'm not with these guys. I never even met most of them until--"
274,JUDGE HOFFMAN,We'll have order.
275,BOBBY,--the indictment.
276,JUDGE HOFFMAN,We will have order.
277,BOBBY,"There are eight of us and there are signs out there that say ""Free the Chicago 7”--I'm not with them."
278,JUDGE HOFFMAN,"Mr. Marshal, will you seat Mr. Seale?"
279,BOBBY,"You're saying it's a conspiracy. I never met most of them until the indictment. Speaking frankly, the U.S. Attorney wanted a Negro defendant to scare the jury. I was thrown in to make the group look scarier. I came to Chicago, I gave a speech, I had a chicken pot pie, went to the airport and flew back to Oakland and that's why they call the eight of us the Chicago-- (to the MARSHAL) --get your hands off me."
280,JUDGE HOFFMAN,Charge Mr. Seale with one count of Contempt of Court.
281,TOM,We have to make a decision right now--a decision I just assumed we'd already made four months ago when trial prep began. Are we using this trial to defend ourselves against very serious charges that could land us in prison for 10 years or are we using it to say a pointless fuck you to the establishment?
282,JERRY,Fuck you.
283,TOM,"That's what I was afraid--Wait, I don't know if you were saying ""fuck you” or answering the question."
284,ABBIE,I was also confused.
285,JERRY,"If we leave here without saying anything about why we came in the first place, it'll be heartbreaking."
286,TOM,If the jury finds us guilty we're not gonna be leaving here at all. And the only thing we need to say about why we came is that it wasn't to incite violence.
287,DAVE,I'm with Jerry.
288,TOM,(beat) Why?
289,DAVE,The trial shouldn't be about us. 38.
290,ABBIE,To end the war.
291,TOM,"Guys, before you tether yourselves to this man, just know that the very last thing he wants is for the war to end."
292,DAVE,Hang on--
293,TOM,I don't have time for cultural revolution. It distracts from actual revolution.
294,KUNSTLER,"Alright, did everybody get everything off their chests?"
295,FRED,(to KUNSTLER) What in the name of hell was that?!
296,KUNSTLER,Evidently not.
297,FRED,You stood up and spoke for Bobby.
298,KUNSTLER,I made it very clear I'm not his lawyer.
299,FRED,I'd like to sit in on these meetings.
300,KUNSTLER,You can't.
301,FRED,I think I will anyway.
302,KUNSTLER,Fred--
303,FRED,Bobby's life is at stake and you guys are playin' to the crowd? 41.
304,KUNSTLER,"Keep trying, alright?"
305,MARSHAL,We're back.
306,KUNSTLER,"Let's go. Abbie, Jerry, unless you're asked a direct question, shut your mouths while we're in that room."
307,ABBIE,(barely audible) This is a political trial.
308,KUNSTLER,What?
309,ABBIE,This is a political trial. That was already decided for us. Ignoring that reality is just...weird to me.
310,KUNSTLER,There are civil trials and there are criminal trials. There's no such thing as a political trial.
311,ABBIE,(beat--smiles) Okay.
312,WEINGLASS,Abbie's smarter than you think he is.
313,TOM,Cows are smarter than I think he is.
314,STAHL,S-T-A-H-L.
315,SCHULTZ,What is your occupation?
316,STAHL,I am the mayor's administrative officer.
317,SCHULTZ,"Calling your attention to March 26th, 1968, did you have a meeting on that day?"
318,STAHL,Yes.
319,SCHULTZ,With whom?
320,STAHL,"Mr. Hoffman, Mr. Rubin is it?"
321,ABBIE,Abbie and Jerry's fine.
322,CUT BACK TO:,
323,SCHULTZ,What was said at the meeting? 44.
324,STAHL,"I was told that the Youth International Party would be holding a Festival of Life in Grant Park during the Democratic National Convention, that there would be thousands of young people attending and that there would be rock bands playing in the park."
325,JERRY,Music will be performed.
326,STAHL,Rock music?
327,JERRY,I would think.
328,CUT BACK TO:,
329,STAHL,They also said there would be public fornication.
330,SCHULTZ,"Say that again, sir?"
331,JERRY,Public fornication.
332,STAHL,You're asking for a parks permit for public--
333,JERRY,Yeah.
334,ABBIE,And rock music.
335,STAHL,No. Of course not. 45.
336,ABBIE,What if it was R&B?
337,CUT BACK TO:,
338,SCHULTZ,Did you issue the permits?
339,STAHL,I did not.
340,SCHULTZ,And what if anything did Abbie Hoffman say when you denied the request for the permits?
341,ABBIE,"Mr. Stahl, you need to understand something. There's going to be a Festival of Life in Grant Park and it will be held during the convention. Bands will play rock music. There will be public fornication, likely some of it with the wives and mistresses of delegates. Psychedelic long-haired leftists will consort with dope users. And we're going to insist that the next President of the United States stop sending our friends to be slaughtered. These things are going to happen whether you give us the permit or not."
342,STAHL,The hotel rooms will be filled with delegates. Where will people sleep?
343,ABBIE,Some people will sleep in tents. Others will live frivolously.
344,STAHL,How many people are coming here? 46.
345,JERRY,A lot.
346,STAHL,What's alot? A thousand? Two- thousand?
347,JERRY,Ten-thousand.
348,STAHL,Jesus Christ.
349,ABBIE,Right?
350,CUT BACK TO:,
351,SCHULTZ,Did Abbie Hoffman add something at the end of that meeting?
352,STAHL,Yes.
353,SCHULTZ,What did he say?
354,STAHL,He said--
355,ABBIE,Or you could gimme a hundred grand and I could call the whole thing off.
356,CUT BACK TO:,
357,SCHULTZ,Thank you.
358,JUDGE HOFFMAN,Mr. Feinglass? 47.
359,WEINGLASS,"Weinglass, sir. Mr. Stahl, the meeting you just described with Mr. Hoffman and Mr. Rubin, was that the only meeting you had with any of the defendants?"
360,STAHL,No.
361,WEINGLASS,On August 2nd you had a meeting with Tom Hayden and Rennie Davis.
362,TOM,Tom Hayden.
363,RENNIE,Rennie Davis.
364,CUT BACK TO:,
365,WEINGLASS,And on August 12th you had a meeting with David Dellinger.
366,STAHL,(to DAVE) I'll tell you the same thing I told the others.
367,CUT BACK TO:,48.
368,WEINGLASS,There were two more meetings with Tom and Rennie--on the 10th and 12th of August--and there was one more meeting with David Dellinger on the 26th.
369,STAHL,I can't be sure of the dates.
370,WEINGLASS,"I can be sure, they're recorded in the log at City Hall."
371,STAHL,Okay.
372,WEINGLASS,"And at each meeting, a request was made for a permit to demonstrate in Grant Park during the convention."
373,DAVE,"Mr. Stahl, we intend a peaceful demonstration. We're not interested in violence or disturbing the delegates."
374,CUT BACK TO:,
375,WEINGLASS,And at each meeting the request for permits was denied.
376,STAHL,"I'll tell you the same thing I told Mr. Hoffman, Mr. Rubin and Mr. Dellinger--"
377,TOM,Sir-- 49.
378,STAHL,There will be no demonstrations within sight of the Hilton.
379,TOM,"We need to demonstrate near the Hilton, that's where the convention is."
380,STAHL,There will be no demonstrations within sight of the Hilton.
381,TOM,"Okay, but the thing is, there will be."
382,STAHL,"Is that a threat, Mr. Hayden?"
383,TOM,"No. We're cautioning you. Thousands of people are coming to Chicago and if they're not given a place to demonstrate they're gonna demonstrate wherever they're standing. It's reckless, irresponsible and foolishly dangerous of the city not to develop a contingency plan. We're gonna need police security and first aid, traffic control, water, sanitation--"
384,CUT BACK TO:,
385,WEINGLASS,"So five times you were asked for a permit, five times you were advised of the dangers of not providing a location to demonstrate, not providing--"
386,STAHL,"I don't take my instructions from the defendants, sir."
387,WEINGLASS,No you don't. 50.
388,STAHL,No I don't.
389,WEINGLASS,You take them from Mayor Daley.
390,WEINGLASS,You're appointed by the mayor and you serve at his pleasure?
391,STAHL,Yes.
392,WEINGLASS,And you're subject to removal in the same manner by the mayor?
393,STAHL,(beat) Yes.
394,KUNSTLER,Thank you.
395,JUDGE HOFFMAN,"Further cross examination, Mr. Kunstler?"
396,KUNSTLER,"Yes, sir. Mr. Stahl--"
397,JUDGE HOFFMAN,"Excuse me, Mr. Seale, would you identify the man sitting behind you? (beat) Mr. Seale?"
398,BOBBY,No sir.
399,JUDGE HOFFMAN,No?
400,BOBBY,That's right.
401,JUDGE HOFFMAN,Why not?
402,BOBBY,He's not on trial here. 51.
403,JUDGE HOFFMAN,"Mr. Seale, identify the man sitting behind you."
404,BOBBY,His name is Fred Hampton.
405,JUDGE HOFFMAN,Let the record indicate that Mr. Hampton is the head of the Chicago chapter of the Black Panther Party.
406,KUNSTLER,"Your Honor, Mr. Hampton isn't at the bar, why is the record identifying him at all?"
407,JUDGE HOFFMAN,Mr. Hampton is clearly giving Mr. Seale legal advice.
408,BOBBY,My lawyer is Charles Garry.
409,KUNSTLER,"Excuse me, sir, but for all you know Mr. Hampton is giving Mr. Seale the score of the White Sox game."
410,JUDGE HOFFMAN,I will assume that he's not.
411,KUNSTLER,Why?
412,JUDGE HOFFMAN,Because that's what happens when you don't have a lawyer. The Court assumes that you're being represented by the Black Panther sitting behind you. Continue.
413,KUNSTLER,"Mr. Stahl, when Abbie offered to call the whole thing off for a hundred-thousand dollars, did you think he was serious or did you think he was making a joke? 52."
414,JUDGE HOFFMAN,"Sit, Mr. Seale."
415,REPORTER #7,Why won't Bobby Seale let anyone represent him?
416,JERRY,You've posed that question in the form of a lie.
417,JERRY,Bobby Seale's lawyer is Charles Garry who's in the hospital right now. A motion was made for postponement and it was denied by a judge who just for the heck of it is suspending due process for a while.
418,BERNADINE,"(into the phone) Conspiracy office, can you hold on? (another line) Conspiracy office, can you hold on?"
419,KUNSTLER,Maybe you don't want to call it the conspiracy office.
420,BERNADINE,They understand irony and appreciate the humor.
421,KUNSTLER,I wouldn't count on it.
422,BERNADINE,"Most people are smart, Bill."
423,KUNSTLER,"If you believe that, you're gonna get your heart broken every day of your life."
424,BERNADINE,"(to KUNSTLER) Hang on. (she goes back to the first caller) Hi, how can I help you?"
425,KUNSTLER,(quietly) Messages?
426,BERNADINE,"(into the phone) We sure do take contributions, we've got high-priced lawyers."
427,KUNSTLER,"The high-priced lawyers are working for free, it's the support staff that needs--"
428,BERNADINE,(into phone) We can't take grass.
429,ABBIE,Hey! 57.
430,BERNADINE,"(into the phone) Yeah, Abbie says we'll take the weed."
431,KUNSTLER,(quietly) Messages.
432,BERNADINE,(into the phone) Lemme give you our mailing address.
433,KUNSTLER,I don't want you guys holding press conferences.
434,TOM,If you're gonna get between Abbie and a camera I'd wear pads and a helmet.
435,KUNSTLER,We had a good day. (to WEINGLASS) Tell him we had a good day.
436,WEINGLASS,6 and 11?
437,KUNSTLER,Yeah.
438,TOM,What does that mean?
439,WEINGLASS,Jurors 6 and 11. They're with us.
440,TOM,How do you know? 58.
441,WEINGLASS,6 made sure I saw a copy of a James Baldwin novel under her arm and 11's been nodding during the Stahl cross.
442,TOM,Falling asleep?
443,WEINGLASS,(demonstrating) Nodding. Agreeing.
444,REPORTER #8,Would you have taken a hundred- thousand dollars to call the whole thing off?
445,ABBIE,I'd have taken a hundred-thousand dollars. As for calling it off...
446,REPORTER #9,How much is it worth to you? What's your price?
447,ABBIE,To call off the revolution?
448,REPORTER #9,What's your price?
449,ABBIE,My life.
450,FROINES,(quietly) Any idea what's going on?
451,WEINER,(quietly) It's been years since I've had any idea what was going on.
452,JUDGE HOFFMAN,I'm going to adjourn the court for the day and see counsel in my chambers in 15 minutes.
453,JUDGE HOFFMAN,It's been brought to my attention that two of the jurors have received threatening notes from a member or members of the Black Panther Party.
454,KUNSTLER,Which two jurors?
455,JUDGE HOFFMAN,Juror number 6 and Juror number 11. It was slipped into the mail at the homes of their parents.
456,KUNSTLER,6 and 11.
457,JUDGE HOFFMAN,(to the MARSHAL) Bring in Juror 6. 60.
458,KUNSTLER,"Judge, I wonder if we could--"
459,JUDGE HOFFMAN,"Juror Number 6, how are you?"
460,JUROR #6,I'm fine.
461,KUNSTLER,"Judge, before we speak to--"
462,JUDGE HOFFMAN,(stopping him) Please. (to JUROR #6) Your parents received this note in their mail this morning. They called the police as they should have done. I'd like you to take the note and read it out loud.
463,JUROR #6,My parents?
464,KUNSTLER,Your Honor--
465,JUDGE HOFFMAN,Please read the note out loud.
466,JUROR #6,"(reading) ""We're watching you.”"
467,JUDGE HOFFMAN,And you see who's signed it.
468,JUROR #6,"""The Panthers”."
469,JUDGE HOFFMAN,"And you understand that to mean the Black Panthers, don't you?"
470,JUDGE HOFFMAN,And you understand that defendant Bobby Seale is the head of the Black Panthers.
471,KUNSTLER,Judge--
472,JUDGE HOFFMAN,He's the Chairman of the Black Panther Party.
473,JUDGE HOFFMAN,Do you still feel you can render a fair and impartial verdict?
474,JUDGE HOFFMAN,"Juror Number 6, your family has been threatened and so have you by members of an organization led by one of the defendants."
475,KUNSTLER,"Judge, for the love of Christ--"
476,KUNSTLER,"I apologize, Your Honor."
477,JUDGE HOFFMAN,I would think so. (beat) Do you still feel you can render a fair and impartial verdict?
478,JUROR #6,(barely a whisper) No sir.
479,JUDGE HOFFMAN,You're dismissed from this jury. Thank you for your service. Please bring in Juror Number 11.
480,JUROR #6,(quietly to WEINGLASS) I'm sorry. 62.
481,WEINGLASS,(quietly) Keep reading James Baldwin.
482,FORAN,(to KUNSTLER) I thought the Panthers were smarter than that.
483,KUNSTLER,They are.
484,FORAN,Well--
485,KUNSTLER,"The Panthers don't write letters any more than the mob does, and the moment I find out it was your office that did, you're gonna see the criminal justice system up closer than you ever wanted to."
486,TOM,Who are the alternates?
487,JERRY,We're gonna make this public. 63.
488,KUNSTLER,Help yourself.
489,TOM,Who are they?
490,JERRY,Somebody other than the FBI has to investigate that letter.
491,KUNSTLER,"Who'd you have in mind, Jefferson Airplane? The FBI investigates--"
492,JERRY,This is bullshit!
493,TOM,Who are the alternates?
494,JERRY,Fuckin' bullshit.
495,DAVE,Can we clean up our language?
496,WEINGLASS,Kay Richards. She's a 27-year old dental hygienist.
497,TOM,That doesn't sound too bad.
498,KUNSTLER,We think she's dating a guy named Tom Bannercheck who works for Daley.
499,ALL,"What?!, etc./ You let her be an alternate?!, etc./ Why would she be anywhere near that jury box?!/etc."
500,KUNSTLER,(simultaneously) We were out of preemptory challenges. 64.
501,WEINGLASS,(simultaneously) She was an alternate and we were out of preemptory challenges.
502,TOM,How did that happen?
503,KUNSTLER,It was her or the Korean War vet who kicked his son out of the house for protesting the Vietnam-- you don't have to be Clarence Darrow to- -
504,JERRY,Did they manipulate the jury pool? How come there's nobody who looks like me?
505,KUNSTLER,Raise your hand if you've ever shown up for jury duty.
506,KUNSTLER,Then shut the fuck up.
507,WEINGLASS,Bill.
508,KUNSTLER,Yeah.
509,TOM,What?
510,WEINGLASS,He's sequestering the jury.
511,JERRY,'Course he is.
512,ABBIE,No such thing as a political trial. Good to know.
513,KUNSTLER,(to WEINGLASS) I want an expert in geriatric psychiatry sitting in the gallery for a few days. I want a medical evaluation of this judge.
514,WEINGLASS,The sequester's probably a reaction to Abbie doing stand-up on the weekends.
515,ABBIE,It's not stand-up.
516,WEINGLASS,"It's you in a college auditorium in a spotlight telling jokes, right?"
517,ABBIE,Little reductive.
518,JERRY,Hey.
519,FROINES,Names?
520,RENNIE,Yeah. From yesterday.
521,TOM,Is anyone hungry?
522,RENNIE,"If I hadn't asked you to help me with Sara Beth, none of this-- 66."
523,TOM,No.
524,RENNIE,I asked you to help with Sara Beth and that's what got us the first riot. The first riot got us the real riot.
525,TOM,"Rennie, that's not what--"
526,RENNIE,Hang on.
527,BERNADINE,(to RENNIE) I'll add the names.
528,RENNIE,Thank you.
529,KUNSTLER,We move to strike the order of sequestration of the jury which was made by Your Honor's sua sponte motion.
530,JUDGE HOFFMAN,"Hold on. Mr. Rubin, Mr. Hoffman, what are you wearing?"
531,ABBIE,"It's an homage to you, sir. 67."
532,JUDGE HOFFMAN,Do you have clothes underneath there?
533,ABBIE,Yes sir. Hang on. (to JERRY) Do you?
534,JERRY,Yeah.
535,JUDGE HOFFMAN,Take off the robes.
536,JUDGE HOFFMAN,(TO KUNSTLER) Continue.
537,KUNSTLER,We feel that sequestration for what appears will be a considerable period of time can only serve--
538,JUDGE HOFFMAN,It would be a considerably shorter period of time if the defense made fewer objections.
539,KUNSTLER,"--can only serve to the defendants disadvantage. And Your Honor, the defense will make not one fewer objection than the prosecution or this Court gives us reason to."
540,JUDGE HOFFMAN,"Bailiff, charge Mr. Kunstler with one count of Contempt."
541,ABBIE,"Welcome to our world, Bill."
542,KUNSTLER,May I continue my argument so it appears in the record? 68.
543,JUDGE HOFFMAN,Continue.
544,KUNSTLER,The jury will be in the custody of deputy marshals. The marshals will take care of all the wants and needs of the jurors and we feel that tends to make the jurors more sympathetic toward--
545,JUDGE HOFFMAN,I understand.
546,KUNSTLER,"The jurors are going to be taken care of by law enforcement officers. They won't be allowed to go home, they'll have minimal communication with--"
547,CUT BACK TO:,
548,DELUCA,Frank DeLuca.
549,SCHULTZ,And what is your occupation? 69.
550,DELUCA,"I'm a detective with the Police Department, City of Chicago."
551,SCHULTZ,"Calling your attention to August of 1968 during the convention, were you given any specific assignment?"
552,DELUCA,"I was to keep Rennie Davis under surveillance with my partner, Detective Bell."
553,SCHULTZ,"And while surveilling Rennie Davis on Sunday evening, August 25th, the night before the convention began, did you observe Tom Hayden committing a crime?"
554,DELUCA,Yes. Mr. Hayden was letting the air out of the tire of a police vehicle.
555,POLICE OFFICER,The park closes at 11pm by order of the Chicago P.D. You must be out of the park by 11pm. Violators will be prosecuted for trespassing. The park closes at--
556,ABBIE,"It's a strategy of throwin' banana peels all over Chicago and then let the machine stumble. And when it stumbles, it gets into a policy of overkill and starts to devour itself. We'll convince 'em. They'll be convinced. Of what? That we're crazy enough to do anything."
557,JERRY,We think it's important for confrontational tactical knowledge to be understood. Confrontational tactics make us safer. Why? Because the police become afraid. And that's fighting fire with--
558,PROTESTORS,(shouting back) FIRE!
559,TOM,"(to no one) You don't fight fire with fire, you fight it with water, ya jackass."
560,RENNIE,It's a metaphor.
561,TOM,Abbie and his fuckin' banana peels.
562,RENNIE,Also a metaphor. 71.
563,TOM,"Between the cops, the state police and the Guard, Daley's got 15,000 soldiers on the street whose guns are loaded with bullets that are literal."
564,RENNIE,I could make the argument that the bullets were also--
565,TOM,"Yeah, so could I, but don't. The atmosphere's starting to get dangerous and someone's gonna throw a rock. I want to get the word out that we're protesting the war and not the cops."
566,RENNIE,Dammit.
567,TOM,What?
568,RENNIE,"I think those are my guys, I think that's their car."
569,RENNIE,"Yeah, that's them. They're back. They were following me all day. Listen, here's the thing I haven't told you about Sara Beth. She isn't into this at all."
570,TOM,Isn't into what?
571,RENNIE,"When I'm with her and her family, I try to...de-emphasize the...radical revolutionary part of my--"
572,TOM,Got it. 72.
573,RENNIE,She and her parents are letting me stay with them and if I show up tailed by two undercover police officers--
574,TOM,That'd be hard to explain.
575,RENNIE,This isn't her world. And it's definitely not her parents' world. If I bring my world into their driveway--
576,TOM,Yeah.
577,RENNIE,She'll break up with me.
578,TOM,You could be in a healthier relationship.
579,RENNIE,"I know, but until then, this is the one I've got."
580,TOM,(pause) That's their car?
581,RENNIE,Yeah.
582,TOM,Where are they?
583,RENNIE,Looking for me.
584,TOM,Alright. Go back into the crowd and let 'em find you. Then leave the park by the east exit. They'll need their car to follow you.
585,RENNIE,What are you gonna do? 73.
586,TOM,It's not gonna remind anyone of Ghandi but a little civil disobedience. Go.
587,RENNIE,"You're not gonna cut their breaks or anything, right?"
588,TOM,"What? No, I'm gonna let the air out of one of the tires. Now go."
589,RENNIE,I really appreciate it. I don't want to be a phony with SaraBeth but sometimes it takes a little--
590,TOM,You should really go now.
591,RENNIE,Yeah.
592,CUT BACK TO:,
593,DELUCA,Detective Bell and I spotted Rennie Davis walking in the crowd and observed him on foot for a few minutes. Then we returned to the unit.
594,SCHULTZ,Your car.
595,DELUCA,Yes.
596,SCHULTZ,And what did you find?
597,DELUCA,So you think we're idiots.
598,DELUCA,Don't fuckin' move.
599,BELL,On your feet.
600,TOM,Those are two contradictory instructions.
601,DELUCA,"Hands behind your head, spread your legs. Was that a contradictory instruction?"
602,TOM,Nope.
603,CUT BACK TO:,
604,SCHULTZ,What happened then?
605,DELUCA,Someone from the crowd shouted--
606,DEMONSTRATOR,"Hey, they're hassling Tom Hayden! 75."
607,BELL,"Paulie, you need to see what I'm seeing."
608,DELUCA,"Hey, stay back there! All a you!"
609,BELL,(showing his badge) Police! Stay back!
610,TOM,"(calling to the silhouettes) Listen, everybody stay cool!"
611,DELUCA,(to TOM) Shut up! Tell 'em to get back.
612,TOM,Again--
613,DELUCA,Tell 'em to get back.
614,SCHULTZ,And did he tell the crowd to get back?
615,TOM,"Everybody get back! I'm alright, stay cool!"
616,DELUCA,He was egging them on.
617,SCHULTZ,Did you take Hayden under arrest at that moment? 76.
618,DELUCA,No sir.
619,SCHULTZ,Why not?
620,DELUCA,What the hell is--who's shining that?
621,BELL,(quietly) It's a camera. It's a TV camera.
622,DELUCA,We wanted to diffuse the situation so we arranged to take Mr. Hayden in the next morning.
623,TOM,This is gonna be for me.
624,RENNIE,Let me try to explain to them.
625,TOM,We should tell 'em about SaraBeth's parents.
626,RENNIE,Yeah.
627,TOM,"I was kidding. Just bail me out and keep to the schedule, it's fine"
628,OFFICER QUINN,Tom Hayden?
629,TOM,Yeah. (to RENNIE) See you in a bit.
630,OFFICER QUINN,You're under arrest.
631,TOM,Got it.
632,JUDGE HOFFMAN,We'll stand in recess for one hour and court will resume at--
633,BOBBY,Your Honor--
634,JUDGE HOFFMAN,"You wish to address the court, Mr. Seale?"
635,BOBBY,I--yes. I have a motion--
636,JUDGE HOFFMAN,I will hear you Mr. Seale.
637,BOBBY,Just a moment.
638,JUDGE HOFFMAN,"Mr. Seale, do you have a motion?"
639,BOBBY,"I have a motion pro se to defend myself. I'd like to invoke the precedent of Adams vs. U.S. ex rel. McCann, where the Supreme Court--"
640,JUDGE HOFFMAN,"Alright, that's enough. Where are you learning these things. Does your young friend, Mr. Hampton, have a background in-- 78."
641,ABBIE,"So Hayden's in a holding cell on a tire-pressure related charge and suddenly every freak in Chicago is mobilized. ""They got Hayden, they got Hayden.” We're gonna march down to the police station, overcome the police and the Illinois National Guard and free Tom Hayden. (pause) We couldn't find our way out of the park."
642,ABBIE,"Over the course of 10 days, the government called 37 witnesses, each and every one of them an employee of the government. I call this portion of the trial, ""With Friends Like These...”."
643,SCHULTZ,Would you state your full name please?
644,WOJOHOWSKI,Stanley R. Wojohowski.
645,EDDIE,Abbie. This is Stan.
646,WOJOHOWSKI,Stan Wojohowski. 80.
647,ABBIE,"How you doin', Stan?"
648,EDDIE,"Stan's gonna be one of your bodyguards, he handles himself pretty well."
649,CUT BACK TO:,
650,SCHULTZ,"And what is your occupation please, Mr. Wojohowski?"
651,WOJOHOWSKI,I'm a Chicago Police Officer.
652,MAN,"Rennie, this is Sam, he can be trusted."
653,CUT BACK TO:,
654,SAM,"Detective Sam McGiven, Chicago Police Department."
655,SCOTT,"Scotty Scibelli, Tom. I'm your guy for ass, weed or whatever you need."
656,CUT BACK TO:,81.
657,SCOTT,"Staff Sergeant Scott Scibelli, Illinois State Police."
658,BARTENDER,This is from the woman in the glasses.
659,JERRY,Really?
660,JERRY,Uh...Did you mean this for me?
661,DAPHNE,I did.
662,JERRY,Nobody's ever sent me a drink before.
663,DAPHNE,How do you like it so far?
664,JERRY,"It's a Tom Collins. I know it's kind of a country club drink but they're delicious. A man in England named Tom Collins claimed in 1894 to have invented it, but then another man who's name I've forgotten said, no, he'd invented it two years earlier and I think there was a lawsuit."
665,DAPHNE,That's a surprising amount of controversy for gin and lemonade.
666,JERRY,I'm Jerry. 82.
667,DAPHNE,"Hey Jerry, do you know why the French only eat one egg for breakfast?"
668,JERRY,No.
669,DAPHNE,"Because in France, one egg is ""un oeuf.” (pause) It's un oeuf."
670,JERRY,Wow.
671,DAPHNE,I know.
672,JERRY,I feel so much better about my Tom Collins story.
673,DAPHNE,I'm Daphne O'Connor.
674,CUT BACK TO:,
675,DAPHNE,"Special Agent Daphne O'Conner, FBI. Counter Intelligence."
676,WEINER,"You think it's possible there were seven demonstrators in Chicago last summer leading 10,000 undercover cops in protest?"
677,SCHULTZ,What was your assignment in Chicago? 83.
678,DAPHNE,To use Jerry Rubin to try to infiltrate the leaders of the protest.
679,SCHULTZ,"You were with Jerry Rubin, Abbie Hoffman, Rennie Davis and Dave Dellinger the afternoon of the 27th?"
680,DAPHNE,Yes.
681,SCHULTZ,What were the four of them doing?
682,DAPHNE,They were leading a group of protestors.
683,SCHULTZ,How many would you say?
684,DAPHNE,About eight-hundred.
685,SCHULTZ,Where were they leading these eight- hundred people?
686,DAPHNE,To Police Headquarters at 11th and State.
687,SCHULTZ,Why?
688,DAPHNE,Tom Hayden was being   held there on charges of tampering   with a police vehicle. Jerry Rubin   said it was time to confront the   pigs.
689,SCHULTZ,By pigs he meant--
690,DAPHNE,It was time to confront the police. 84.
691,CUT BACK TO:,
692,SAM,I remember also at the front of the group was Mr. Allen Ginsburg.
693,SCHULTZ,Allen Ginsburg the poet.
694,SAM,Yes. He was chanting a kind of war chant.
695,JERRY,What's he doing?
696,ABBIE,"He's calming the energy, settling things down."
697,DAVE,How's it working so far?
698,ABBIE,The guy testified that Ginsburg was letting out a war chant. Some kind of fuckin' jungle signal to beat poets that they should begin pelting the troopers with blank verse.
699,ABBIE,A guy in the crowd is marching with a girl on his shoulders. She's waving an American flag and this seems to really be bothering some frat brothers who'd come to town in the spirit of fraternity.
700,FRAT BOYS,(screaming) Put the flag down! Put it down! Go to the kitchen and make me a sandwich!
701,JERRY,I'm gonna go back there and take care of that.
702,ABBIE,They're not the enemy.
703,JERRY,In so many fuckin' ways they are.
704,FRAT BOYS,Put down the goddam flag you ugly bitch! Go to the kitchen and make me a fuckin' sandwich!
705,CUT BACK TO:,86.
706,WOJOHOWSKI,The group turned right on 11th Street.
707,ABBIE,We make a right on 11th Street.
708,DAPHNE,And that's when they saw it.
709,ABBIE,Holy shit.
710,JERRY,Jesus.
711,ABBIE,Are they about to conquer Spain?
712,JERRY,(beat--let's do it anyway) Well fuck it.
713,DAVE,What do you mean fuck it?
714,JERRY,This is it. It's time. Here we are.
715,ABBIE,We're not rushing the police.
716,JERRY,Why the fuck not?
717,ABBIE,Because we'll be critically injured. 87.
718,RENNIE,Tom doesn't want anyone hurt.
719,DAVE,"We've gotta turn this crowd around. There's too much momentum, we've gotta turn 'em around and calm 'em down."
720,DAPHNE,"(to JERRY) He's right. This isn't safe, I know something about this."
721,DAVE,(into the walkie-talkie) All marshals--slow 'em down and turn 'em around. It's the Alamo up here. Turn 'em around and get 'em safely back in the park.
722,JERRY,We should be marching right up to them.
723,ABBIE,"I don't think they're gonna surrender man. Keep 'em moving. Dave and I are gonna stay and make Tom's bail. (to DAVE) I don't carry money, do you?"
724,DAVE,"I do, I'm a grown man."
725,JERRY,"You're killin' me, Allen. You're goddam killin' me. (shouting) Keep 'em moving. 88."
726,ABBIE,"The marshals are spreading the word that we're gonna keep moving, go left on Roosevelt and back in the park, right?"
727,DAPHNE,When they got to the park they saw that three divisions of police officers had moved in from the south.
728,ABBIE,"I don't know what tactical genius came up with that, but you know when shit happens? When you don't give protestors a place to go."
729,SCHULTZ,How would you characterize the mood of the crowd?
730,KUNSTLER,The witness is in no position to characterize the mood of a thousand strangers.
731,JUDGE HOFFMAN,Do you have an objection?
732,KUNSTLER,Yes sir.
733,JUDGE HOFFMAN,On what grounds? 89.
734,KUNSTLER,On those grounds.
735,ALL,Overruled!
736,JUDGE HOFFMAN,I will clear this courtroom!
737,SCHULTZ,Mr. Wojohowski?
738,WOJOHOWSKI,The crowd was looking for a fight.
739,JERRY,(shouting) You're pigs! Your children are pigs!
740,RENNIE,We should leave their children out of it.
741,JERRY,"You're right, I know, you're right."
742,SCOTT,"""White, honkey m-f-ers, get out of our park!” And then he said, ""Look at 'em--"
743,JERRY,--they don't look so tough.
744,RENNIE,Well...the guns... 90.
745,JERRY,"(shouting) Put down your guns, motherfuckers, we'll fight like fuckin' men!"
746,RENNIE,"Just so you know, I do not have your back on that."
747,ABBIE,And the guys from Kappa Gamma Douchebag who were hassling the girl? They're back.
748,FRAT BOYS,Put the flag down! Put it down! Put the goddam flag down you cunt! Make me a sandwich!
749,RENNIE,"(to JERRY) Just calm the crowd down. (beat) Help me calm 'em down, Jerry."
750,DAPHNE,Baby. Defuse the situation. They'll listen to you.
751,JERRY,Huh.
752,DAPHNE,What?
753,JERRY,"Nothing, that sounded nice when you said it."
754,DAPHNE,Right now!
755,JERRY,Yeah. 91.
756,DAPHNE,Someone from the crowd shouts--
757,ABBIE,A guy somewhere in the crowd shouts- -
758,SCOTT,--it may have been Jerry Rubin--
759,KUNSTLER,Object.
760,WEINGLASS,(simultaneously) Objection.
761,KUNSTLER,If he doesn't know who it was--
762,JUDGE HOFFMAN,Sustained.
763,SCHULTZ,Someone in the crowd shouted what?
764,SOMEONE IN THE CROWD,(shouting) Take the hill!
765,RENNIE,Shit.
766,JERRY,Oh fuck. 92.
767,RENNIE,(to the protestors) Stop running!
768,JERRY,(to the protestors) Stop running! Slow down!
769,POLICEMAN,There are no permits for this demonstration! You are ordered to leave the park immediately! There are no permits for this demonstration! You are ordered to leave the park immediately!
770,ABBIE,"The street name for chloroacetophenone is tear gas and it's a fuckin' blow torch--your lungs, your skin, your eyes...Riot clubs? They're made out of the same wood they use for baseball bats."
771,FRAT BOY #1,"I told you to put that flag down, go in the kitchen and make me a fuckin' sandwich! 93."
772,JERRY,Hey! What are you doin?! Get the fuck offa her! What the fuck is the matter with you?!
773,JERRY,Get the fuck offa her!
774,FRAT BOY #2,"Fuck you, hippie faggot!"
775,JERRY,You're alright. You're okay.
776,JERRY,Here. You're okay.
777,JERRY,You need to hold this over your face and I'll get you outa here.
778,POLICEMAN,"Don't move, Jerry."
779,JERRY,"Get those guys, they were--"
780,POLICEMAN,You're under arrest.
781,KUNSTLER,"After bailing Tom Hayden out, Abbie, Dave and Tom returned to the park, is that correct?"
782,TOM,"I'll be honest, I'm starting to worry about getting everyone out of Chicago alive."
783,ABBIE,That's not really up to us.
784,TOM,Yeah it is.
785,ABBIE,What are you lookin' at me for? I went to bail you out of jail.
786,TOM,(pause) Eight-hundred people followed you!
787,ABBIE,"Oh that. Yeah, people follow me, fuck if I know why?"
788,TOM,I'm wracking my brain as well. 95.
789,RENNIE,(to JERRY) How'd you make bail so fast?
790,JERRY,"I wasn't arrested, I was detained. They couldn't figure out what to charge me with."
791,DAVE,Assault.
792,JERRY,I was assaulting someone who was assaulting someone.
793,DAPHNE,Guys. Nothing's more dangerous than a crowd of people who are moving. It's like trying to re-direct the Mississippi River.
794,JERRY,Isn't she great?
795,TOM,(to ABBIE) Get your people to cool off. We're responsible for these people.
796,ABBIE,"We have to protest in front of the convention, Tommy, plain and simple. 'Cause that's where the cameras are. We have to get to the convention. And that means we have to leave the park. And that's when people'll get hurt. As long as every person following me knows that, I sleep fine at night."
797,TOM,Well you should tell me how you do it.
798,ABBIE,A lot of it's drugs.
799,TOM,Yeah.
800,TOM,That's what happened when we tried to go up a hill. We're not getting anywhere near the convention.
801,KUNSTLER,"Special Agent O'Connor, you testified that Jerry Rubin said, ""Fuck 'em all. They're all pigs. We should form an army and get guns.”"
802,DAPHNE,Yes.
803,KUNSTLER,"And when he said that, did anyone form an army and get guns?"
804,DAPHNE,No.
805,KUNSTLER,Did Jerry Rubin instruct the crowd to run into the park?
806,DAPHNE,No.
807,KUNSTLER,Did Rennie Davis?
808,DAPHNE,No.
809,KUNSTLER,Was Abbie Hoffman even there?
810,DAPHNE,No.
811,KUNSTLER,Was Dave Dellinger?
812,DAPHNE,No. 97.
813,JUDGE HOFFMAN,We'll stand in recess until--
814,FRED,Four hours. That's how long Bobby Seale--
815,JUDGE HOFFMAN,Marshals.
816,FRED,--was in Chicago. Four hours.
817,JUDGE HOFFMAN,Court stands in recess for the weekend.
818,JERRY,I took in the exhibit. I cleared my mind. I stood there for twenty minutes and I felt nothing.
819,ABBIE,"Well...but it wasn't a painting, it was an exhibit. It was a natural history museum. 99."
820,JERRY,"And when you put exhibits of Native Indian families in a natural history museum alongside dioramas of early man and the Jurassic age, it gives the impression that the Cherokee evolved into modern day Europeans."
821,ABBIE,"Hey, look who it is!"
822,ABBIE,Should we say hi?
823,JERRY,I've got a bone to pick with that guy.
824,ABBIE,Hey counselor!
825,SCHULTZ,No colleges this weekend?
826,ABBIE,Winter break. My audiences went home to their parents. Are these ladies related to you?
827,SCHULTZ,These are my daughters Julie and Emily.
828,ABBIE,(to the girls) Your dad's a good guy. And that's coming from someone who he's been trying hard to put in federal prison.
829,SCHULTZ,We shouldn't be talking without your lawyer here.
830,ABBIE,"Nah, we're all on the same team. 100."
831,SCHULTZ,"In one sense I guess, but in a much truer sense we're not. (SCHULTZ takes a couple of dollars out of his pocket) Girls, take this dollar over to the musicians and put it in their hat. Then take this dollar and buy some of those candy-covered peanuts mom won't let you have."
832,ABBIE,Sweet kids.
833,SCHULTZ,'Cause if your lawyers were here I'd feel comfortable telling you that the window's closing for you to plead out.
834,JERRY,"Oh we're not takin' a fuckin' deal, would you stop? And I wish I could share Abbie's sentiment that you're a good guy, but I'm afraid I can't."
835,SCHULTZ,I'm sorry to hear that.
836,JERRY,Sending Daphne O'Connor to break my heart was way outa line.
837,SCHULTZ,Well I don't work for the FBI but Special Agent O'Connor was one of many agents sent to gather intelligence on what had been deemed a credible domestic threat.
838,JERRY,"Fine, then you bug our phones, you wire up a dope dealer, be a man. You don't send a woman to ensorcell me--it means ""enchanting”--only to have her crush my soul."
839,SCHULTZ,How long did you two know each other? 101.
840,JERRY,(calling) Does she ever mention me?
841,BERNADINE,(into phone) Conspiracy Office.
842,BERNADINE,"(to TOM) It's Bill. Something's happened, Tom."
843,KUNSTLER,"Bobby, Fred Hampton was shot and killed last night. There was a police raid and there was a shootout and he's dead."
844,KUNSTLER,(consulting notes) It happened between the hours of 4am and--
845,BOBBY,I know.
846,KUNSTLER,You were told?
847,BOBBY,Yeah.
848,KUNSTLER,I'm sorry.
849,BOBBY,"(pause) The seven of you, you've all got the same father, right? (to TOM) I'm talking to you. You've all got the same father, right? Cut your hair, don't be a fag, respect authority, respect America, respect me. Your life, it's fuck you to your father, right? A little?"
850,TOM,(beat) Maybe.
851,BOBBY,Maybe. And you can see how that's different from a rope on a tree?
852,TOM,Yeah.
853,BOBBY,Yeah. He was shot in the wrist first. You can't hold a gun if you've been shot in the wrist. You can't pull a trigger. The second shot was in the head. (MORE) 104.
854,BOBBY,Fred was executed. (pause) Anything else?
855,KUNSTLER,(pause) No.
856,SCHULTZ,"Detective, calling your attention to the evening of the next day, Tuesday, August 27th, were you in Grant Park on that day?"
857,FRAPOLY,"Yes. There was a ""Free Huey Newton” rally going on."
858,SCHULTZ,Did you recognize any of the speakers?
859,FRAPOLY,I heard Jerry Rubin give a speech. Phil Ochs sang and then Bobby Seale gave a speech.
860,BOBBY,I object to this man's testimony against me because I've been denied counsel.
861,JUDGE HOFFMAN,We understand.
862,SCHULTZ,Do you recall anything from Mr. Seale's speech?
863,FRAPOLY,Yes. He said-- 105.
864,BOBBY,I object to this man's--
865,JUDGE HOFFMAN,Quiet.
866,SCHULTZ,Go ahead.
867,FRAPOLY,May I refer to notes?
868,SCHULTZ,Yes sir.
869,FRAPOLY,"He said, ""We must understand that as we go forth to try to move the reprobate politicians--"
870,BOBBY,Your Honor--
871,FRAPOLY,"""--our cowardly Congress, the jive, double-lip talkin' Nixon--”"
872,BOBBY,"Jive double-lip talkin' Nixon? You make me sound like one funky cat, thank you sir."
873,JUDGE HOFFMAN,"Last warning, Mr. Seale."
874,SCHULTZ,Did he say anything else?
875,FRAPOLY,"He said, ""The revolution at this time is directly connected to organized guns and force.”"
876,SCHULTZ,No more questions.
877,BOBBY,"A jive, double-lip talkin', funky, funky cat. 106."
878,JUDGE HOFFMAN,Would the defense like to cross- examine the witness?
879,BOBBY,Yes. I'm sitting here saying that I would like to cross--
880,JUDGE HOFFMAN,Only lawyers can address a wit--
881,BOBBY,My lawyer is Charles Garry.
882,JUDGE HOFFMAN,I'm tired of hearing that.
883,BOBBY,I couldn't care less what you're tired of.
884,JUDGE HOFFMAN,What did you say?
885,BOBBY,I said it would be impossible for me to care any less what you're tired of and I demand to cross- examine this--
886,JUDGE HOFFMAN,Sit in your chair and be quiet and don't ever address the Court in that--
887,BOBBY,(to the crowd) It was premeditated murder. Fred Hampton was assassinated last night.
888,JUDGE HOFFMAN,"Marshals, put Mr. Seale in his seat."
889,BOBBY,He wouldn't have been able to hold a gun in his right hand. (MORE) 107.
890,BOBBY,"When they publish the coroner's report, make sure you ask about the bullet wound in his wrist."
891,JUDGE HOFFMAN,"I strongly caution you, Mr. Seale, I strongly caution you that--"
892,BOBBY,Oh strongly fuck yourself.
893,JUDGE HOFFMAN,"Marshals, take that defendant into a room and deal with him as he should be dealt with."
894,JUDGE HOFFMAN,"Let the record show that I tried, fairly and impartially, I tried to get the defendant to sit on his own. I ask you again, and you may indicate by raising your head up and down or moving it from side to side, if I have your assurance that you will not do anything to disrupt this trial if I allow you to resume proper order."
895,JUDGE HOFFMAN,Do I have your assurance?
896,JUDGE HOFFMAN,"Mr. Schultz, call your next witness."
897,JUDGE HOFFMAN,"Mr. Schultz, call your witness."
898,SCHULTZ,"May we approach, Your Honor?"
899,KUNSTLER,Can he breathe? (to BOBBY) Can you breathe alright?
900,SCHULTZ,"Your Honor, a defendant is bound and gagged in an American courtroom."
901,FORAN,He brought it on himself.
902,KUNSTLER,(to FORAN) Are you insane?
903,JUDGE HOFFMAN,That's enough.
904,KUNSTLER,This is an unholy disgrace to the law. This is a medieval torture chamber.
905,JUDGE HOFFMAN,I know no other lawyer who would utter such a thing.
906,WEINGLASS,This is an unholy disgrace to the law and a medieval torture--
907,JUDGE HOFFMAN,"I said that's enough! (beat) Love of God. (beat) What do you want, Mr. Schultz, this is your sidebar."
908,SCHULTZ,"Your Honor, at this time the Government would like to make a motion that Bobby Seale be separated--"
909,FORAN,Wait-- 110.
910,SCHULTZ,(to FORAN) Yes. Just--please sir. (to JUDGE HOFFMAN) --a motion that Bobby Seale be separated from the other defendants and that a mistrial be declared in his case.
911,JUDGE HOFFMAN,You want me to give him his mistrial?
912,KUNSTLER,You took their black guy and made him a sympathetic character.
913,JUDGE HOFFMAN,I've lived a long time and you're the first person who's ever suggested that I've discriminated against a black man.
914,WEINGLASS,Then let the record show that I'm the second.
915,JUDGE HOFFMAN,(pause) Step back.
916,JUDGE HOFFMAN,I'm issuing an order declaring a mistrial as to the defendant Bobby G. Seale.
917,JUDGE HOFFMAN,"Mr. Seale, you're currently charged with 16 counts of contempt for your repeated displays of disrespect, and you have a pending homicide charge in Connecticut. You are not home free and I doubt you ever will be. We're adjourned until ten a.m. Monday."
918,BAILIFF,All rise. 111.
919,BERNADINE,"Conspiracy office, how can I help you?"
920,BERNADINE,"(into the phone) No, sir, I'm a white woman. (listens) Yeah, I've slept with several in my life so far and on balance I'd have to say yes, it is better and to tell you the truth, I think that's a big part of what's got you worked up."
921,WEINGLASS,Hang up the phone.
922,BERNADINE,"(into the phone) It's not even so much that it's bigger, it's just better, you know what I mean?"
923,WEINGLASS,Hang up the phone.
924,WEINGLASS,Was that a parting gift for Bobby?
925,BERNADINE,"No, that was just for me. 112."
926,JERRY,(to TOM) Why the fuck did you stand up?
927,TOM,I was just--it was a reflex.
928,RENNIE,He was respecting the institution.
929,TOM,And I don't know what good it does to insult the judge. And it was in view of the jury. And the press. And Foran and Schultz who'll be recommending sentencing if we're convicted.
930,ABBIE,"It's a revolution, Tom. We may have to hurt somebody's feelings."
931,RENNIE,(pause) So...we have this list. I was thinking maybe Monday morning we could read the names into the record.
932,TOM,Jesus--
933,RENNIE,As a way of saying--
934,TOM,As a way of saying what?
935,RENNIE,"That whatever we're facing, you know, is peanuts compared to what these guys--"
936,TOM,He's the one who's gonna sentence us. (MORE) 113.
937,TOM,The judge gets to decide what we're facing. It's a goddam trial.
938,ABBIE,A political trial.
939,TOM,"No, we were arrested for--the law doesn't recognize political--"
940,ABBIE,"We weren't arrested, we were chosen. Lee, John, have you guys asked yourselves what you're doing here?"
941,WEINER,Every day.
942,ABBIE,"You're a give-back. They give the jury a couple of guys they can acquit and feel better about finding the rest us guilty. Lenny, am I wrong?"
943,WEINGLASS,No.
944,FROINES,Our role in history is that we made it easier to convict our friends? Lee?
945,ABBIE,"They're gonna find us guilty of ""I just don't like you.” That's why Bill won't put any of us on the stand."
946,DAVE,"I could take the stand, I'm easy for them to like. I'm literally a Boy Scout troop leader."
947,KUNSTLER,You're a conscientious objector.
948,DAVE,A lot of people are conscientious-- 114.
949,RENNIE,That thing. Remember? Outgoing cabinet members are supposed to resign as a courtesy but Ramsey Clark didn't tender his resignation until an hour--
950,JERRY,"Yeah, I read Mitchell had a fit about that. (to WEINGLASS) Did you read about that? (beat) Lenny?"
951,JERRY,(beat) Bill?
952,KUNSTLER,He was never even on our witness list.
953,TOM,Who?
954,KUNSTLER,The first witness you'd put on the stand...if this was a political trial. (calling) Bernadine!
955,BERNADINE,Yeah.
956,KUNSTLER,My office needs to find Ramsey Clark.
957,ABBIE,William Kunstler just showed up.
958,KUNSTLER,Lenny.
959,WEINGLASS,"Maybe--I don't know, does he have a Secret Service detail?"
960,KUNSTLER,No. They're here for us.
961,KUNSTLER,"He was the Attorney General, what do we do, we just ring the doorbell?"
962,WEINGLASS,"Yeah, I guess so."
963,KUNSTLER,You want to do it?
964,TOM,Just ring the damn--
965,KUNSTLER,It's a nice house.
966,WEINGLASS,Yeah. 117.
967,KUNSTLER,"(pause) What would you call this, Tudor or Colonial?"
968,KUNSTLER,"Good morning, I'm Bill Kunstler. Mr. Clark is expecting us."
969,JANE,Come in.
970,JANE,He's in his study at the end of the hall. Can I get anyone coffee?
971,KUNSTLER,"I'll tell you, ma'am, that sounds great."
972,WEINGLASS,"Nothing for me, thank you."
973,JANE,The end of the hall.
974,JANE,Mr. Hayden?
975,JANE,I read in the paper you were the only one who stood for the judge after what he did to Bobby.
976,TOM,Oh. That was a mistake. It was a reflex and--
977,KUNSTLER,Tom? 118.
978,TOM,Yeah.
979,CLARK,"Hey, Bill, Ramsey Clark."
980,KUNSTLER,"Pleased to meet you, sir, this is Leonard Weinglass."
981,CLARK,(shaking hands) Mr. Weinglass.
982,KUNSTLER,And Tom Hayden.
983,CLARK,"I know who Tom Hayden is, the FBI used to work for me. These two men are senior deputies with the Justice Department--Mr. Calley and Mr. Howard."
984,KUNSTLER,I don't know what these men are doing here.
985,CLARK,I invited them.
986,KUNSTLER,(pause) You invited them?
987,CLARK,I don't want any appearance of impropriety.
988,KUNSTLER,There isn't any impropriety. 119.
989,CLARK,And now there are witnesses to that.
990,KUNSTLER,"(pause) Sir, these men are going to call Schultz and Foran as soon as we're done here."
991,CLARK,"Don't be ridiculous, they've already called Schultz and Foran and they're gonna call John Mitchell as soon as we're done here. Ask what you want to ask."
992,KUNSTLER,In front of them?
993,CLARK,Mm-hm.
994,KUNSTLER,"(pause) Alright. Mr. Clark, while you were the Attorney General for President Johnson, was there ever a discussion with the White House about seeking indictments against my clients?"
995,HOWARD,He can't answer that.
996,KUNSTLER,Why not?
997,HOWARD,It's against the law.
998,WEINGLASS,That's an overly broad interpretation of the law.
999,KUNSTLER,"That's Lenny's way of saying you're criminally full of shit, Deputy Howard. 120."
1000,HOWARD,Sir--
1001,KUNSTLER,"And I'll tell you what--We've dealt with jury tampering, wire tapping, a defendant who was literally gagged and a judge who's been handing down rulings from the bench that would be considered wrong in Honduras!--so I'm less interested in the law than I was when this trial began."
1002,HOWARD,"Whether you like the law or not, as a former A.G. he's protected by it."
1003,KUNSTLER,"No, you're protected by it-- (to CLARK) --and due respect, sir, I can subpoena you."
1004,HOWARD,Find a judge in this circuit who'll sign that subpoena.
1005,CLARK,He's right. And taking the stand voluntarily would be a big risk for me.
1006,KUNSTLER,"Again, due respect, but my clients take a much bigger risk when they--"
1007,CLARK,What took you so long?
1008,KUNSTLER,"(beat) --when they stand up against enormous power they can't see and-- I'm sorry, what took me so long to do what?"
1009,CLARK,To realize I'm your star witness?
1010,KUNSTLER,"(beat) Well...we were...remarking on that ourselves, but--"
1011,CLARK,Bill--
1012,HOWARD,He can't testify.
1013,CLARK,"I'm in private practice now and if John Mitchell wants to cut me in half, he can and he will."
1014,TOM,"You have to find--Sir, you have to find some courage now and"
1015,CLARK,"Find some courage, yeah."
1016,TOM,Yes--You have to find some courage and--
1017,WEINGLASS,(holding a hand up) Tom.
1018,CLARK,"That's what these two men came to tell me. That if John Mitchell wants to cut me in half, he can and he will. So I wanted them here in the room when I said--When do you want me in court?"
1019,HOWARD,Mr. Clark--
1020,KUNSTLER,I'm sorry?
1021,CLARK,"Swear me in, Bill."
1022,HOWARD,"It's against the law for you to testify, Ramsey, it's that simple. 122."
1023,CLARK,It's General Clark and arrest me or shut the fuck up. (to TOM--simply) Found it.
1024,KUNSTLER,The defense calls Ramsey Clark.
1025,SCHULTZ,"Your Honor, the People move to disallow this witness."
1026,JUDGE HOFFMAN,I'd like the marshals to take the jury from the room.
1027,JUDGE HOFFMAN,Mr. Schultz?
1028,SCHULTZ,The Code of Federal Regulations mandates that the disclosure of Justice Department material is prohibited without prior knowledge of the Attorney General--plainly meaning the sitting Attorney General--who is John Mitchell who has specifically denied his approval.
1029,WEINGLASS,"Judge, the rule refers to very specific kinds of documents and information. If the regulation was interpreted as Mr. Schultz is asking it to be, nobody in the federal government would ever be able to testify in a trial after leaving their job. 123."
1030,JUDGE HOFFMAN,I think the government is at least justified in asking the defense to demonstrate by voir dire the testimony it expects to illicit from the witness.
1031,KUNSTLER,You'd like us to question the witness outside the presence of the jury?
1032,JUDGE HOFFMAN,"If I find any of the testimony relevant I'll call the jury back in to hear it. (pause) Take it or leave it, Mr. Kunstler."
1033,KUNSTLER,Defense calls Ramsey Clark.
1034,BAILIFF,State your name.
1035,CLARK,William Ramsey Clark.
1036,BAILIFF,"Do you swear that the testimony you give will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?"
1037,CLARK,I do.
1038,KUNSTLER,"Mr. Clark, what was your occupation in the summer of 1968?"
1039,CLARK,I was Attorney General of the United States.
1040,KUNSTLER,You were appointed by President Johnson. 124.
1041,JUDGE HOFFMAN,"(beat) Excuse me, sir?"
1042,CLARK,The president isn't a client of the Attorney General. I'm happy to answer.
1043,SCHULTZ,"Your Honor, I don't--hearing from the witness on this point is highly irregular."
1044,JUDGE HOFFMAN,"(pause) Well gentlemen, I'm...This is my courtroom but the witness is the former--he's--and he's just stated his willingness, you know--so for the purposes of voir dire I'll hear the answer."
1045,CLARK,The President asked me if I intended to seek any indictments related to the riots the previous month in Chicago.
1046,KUNSTLER,And what did you tell him?
1047,CLARK,I told him we wouldn't be seeking indictments.
1048,KUNSTLER,Can you tell us why?
1049,CLARK,An investigation by our criminal division led to the clear conclusion that the riots were started by the Chicago Police Department.
1050,SCHULTZ,And the current Justice Department-- the only one that matters--came to a new conclu--
1051,KUNSTLER,And therefore the motivation of the prosecution is now called into--
1052,SCHULTZ,The motivation of the prosecution isn't an issue in a courtroom.
1053,KUNSTLER,Not any courtroom I've ever been in except this one!
1054,FORAN,Object!
1055,JUDGE HOFFMAN,"Mr. Kunstler, do you have any further examination that will demonstrate that this witness will make a material contribution or should I ask him to step down?"
1056,KUNSTLER,You've ruled? You're not going to let the jury hear his testimony?
1057,JUDGE HOFFMAN,"Not unless you can demonstrate to me, which you have not thus far done, that this witness-"
1058,KUNSTLER,Yes sir.
1059,KUNSTLER,(quietly) Are you any good?
1060,JUDGE HOFFMAN,Are you addressing the Court Reporter?
1061,KUNSTLER,(quietly) Keep up with us.. 128.
1062,JUDGE HOFFMAN,Mr. Kunstler.
1063,KUNSTLER,(to CLARK) Is this prosecution politically motivated?
1064,SCHULTZ,Object!
1065,CLARK,Yes.
1066,KUNSTLER,President Nixon inherited an unpopular war?
1067,CLARK,Yes.
1068,JUDGE HOFFMAN,"Step down please, Mr. Clark."
1069,CLARK,And your clients are making it more unpopular every day.
1070,KUNSTLER,"The administration's paranoid about the SDS, the MOBE, the New Left?"
1071,JUDGE HOFFMAN,"Mr. Clark, please. (beat) Please, I'll be forced to find you in Contempt. You understand."
1072,CLARK,"(pause) I do, Your Honor."
1073,KUNSTLER,"(pause) Thank you, sir."
1074,JUDGE HOFFMAN,You may step down.
1075,KUNSTLER,"Your Honor, when the jury returns, will they be informed that the defense had called the former Attorney General but that the Court ruled he couldn't testify?"
1076,JUDGE HOFFMAN,"No, that motion will be denied."
1077,JUDGE HOFFMAN,Cite Mr. Kunstler with his third count of Contempt.
1078,DAVE,(quietly) You're a thug.
1079,JUDGE HOFFMAN,Did one of the defendants speak?
1080,DAVE,(standing) I did. I said you're a thug and you are.
1081,TOM,(quietly) Dave--
1082,JUDGE HOFFMAN,"Please sit, Mr. Dellinger."
1083,DAVE,"If we're guilty, why not give us a trial? If we're--"
1084,JUDGE HOFFMAN,"Marshals, seat the defendant."
1085,DAVE,"If we're guilty, as you clearly decided--"
1086,JUDGE HOFFMAN,Watch yourself.
1087,DAVE,--decided we were a long time ago-- (to a MARSHAL) You don't need to grab my arm. (MORE) 130.
1088,DAVE,"(to JUDGE HOFFMAN) If we're guilty, then why not give us a trial? I've sat here for six months and watched you-- (to a MARSHAL) I'm asking you not to grab--"
1089,JUDGE HOFFMAN,Take him outa here. Lock him up!
1090,DAVE,(calling) I hit him. I'm sorry.
1091,JERRY,There's only one thing--one thing to do. Solidarity with Dave. Tomorrow we go into court and get ourselves arrested.
1092,TOM,We're already arrested.
1093,JERRY,(pause) Is Bill talking to you about taking the stand? (beat) (MORE) 131.
1094,JERRY,Some of the press guys are saying Bill's been talking to you about taking the stand.
1095,TOM,He's been talking to me about it.
1096,JERRY,He thinks you might get the crowd worked up with a position paper?
1097,TOM,Maybe he thinks I won't try to get the crowd worked up at all. Maybe he thinks there are jurors who've relied on the safety of the police and are put off when someone calls them pigs. Or maybe he just wants a witness who dresses like a grown man.
1098,JERRY,The cops in this city in the summer of 1968 were pigs.
1099,TOM,I wonder how many of them have kids in Vietnam.
1100,JERRY,"(to ABBIE) He's gonna take the stand, not you? (beat) We're okay with that?"
1101,JERRY,Abbie!
1102,ABBIE,(to TOM) What did you mean the last thing I want is to end the war?
1103,TOM,(long pause) What? 132.
1104,TOM,Mm-hm.
1105,ABBIE,"And winning elections, that's the first thing on your wish list? Equality, justice, education, poverty and progress--they're second?"
1106,TOM,If we don't win elections it doesn't matter what's second and it's astonishing that someone still has to explain that to you.
1107,RENNIE,"(pause) Okay, so Jerry was talking about--"
1108,ABBIE,(quietly) We don't have any money.
1109,TOM,I'm sorry?
1110,ABBIE,"We don't have any money. So I stage stunts and cameras come, microphones come. And it's astonishing that someone still has to explain that to you."
1111,TOM,You're trading a cow for magic beans.
1112,JERRY,That ended up working.
1113,TOM,What?
1114,JERRY,"The magic beans. There was a giant up there. I can't remember what happened after that, the little boy may have gotten eaten. 134."
1115,FROINES,"No, the giant turned out to be nice."
1116,JERRY,Are you sure?
1117,FROINES,No.
1118,WEINER,It's almost hard to believe the seven of us weren't able to end a war.
1119,ABBIE,(to TOM) Lemme ask you something.
1120,RENNIE,You guys should just shake hands.
1121,ABBIE,You think Chicago would've gone differently if Kennedy got the nomination?
1122,TOM,"Do I think-- (laughs a little) Yes, it--yes. The Irish guys would have sat down with Daley and--yes."
1123,ABBIE,I think so too.
1124,TOM,Yeah.
1125,ABBIE,"That's why I was wondering--weren't you just a little bit happy when the bullet ripped through his head? (beat) No Chicago, no Tom Hayden."
1126,TOM,I WAS ONE OF HIS PALLBEARERS!
1127,ABBIE,"(pushing him off) That's right! (beat) We're not going to jail because of what we did, we're going to jail because of who we are. Think about that the next time you shrug off cultural revolution. We define winning differently you and me."
1128,ABBIE,"Bill, you shoulda seen it. Tom tried to beat me up but through sheer of force of intellectual superiority--"
1129,KUNSTLER,Stop talking. (beat) Just stop talking.
1130,KUNSTLER,Foran's office turned this over tonight in discovery. It was given to them by somebody in the crowd.
1131,KUNSTLER,"No foul play, there are affidavits, they really did just get this."
1132,TOM,What's on the tape?
1133,KUNSTLER,The sound of you starting the Chicago riot.
1134,TOM,(pause) What?
1135,KUNSTLER,Somebody had a tape recorder at the band shell. (MORE) 136.
1136,TOM,Sure. I'll show you what my answers'll sound like.
1137,DAVE,They called him a radical. They called him a criminal. They called him un-American.
1138,TOM,"First of all, it turned out the guy climbing the flagpole was a kid."
1139,KUNSTLER,It seems like you guys attract an awful lot of underage minors.
1140,TOM,(to WEINGLASS) You want to object?
1141,WEINGLASS,Objection.
1142,KUNSTLER,Overruled.
1143,TOM,We attract the people who have the most to lose by this war continuing.
1144,KUNSTLER,I'm glad you brought that up. Did you serve? 138.
1145,TOM,I wasn't drafted. I didn't try to evade the--I had a high number.
1146,KUNSTLER,But you didn't enlist.
1147,TOM,"I did not volunteer to kill Vietnamese people, no."
1148,KUNSTLER,"You testified that you saw at least six policemen start to go after the man--sorry, kid--who was climbing the flagpole."
1149,TOM,Yes.
1150,KUNSTLER,It was dark and you were a hundred yards away. Do you have telescopic night vision?
1151,TOM,There were floodlights.
1152,DAVE,"And when they called him anti- American. He said, ""No. That ignominious distinction goes to those who mouth American values--"
1153,DAVE,--while breaking America's heart.”
1154,RENNIE,(shouting) Hey! It's alright! He's a kid! We'll get him down!
1155,DAVE,I'd like to introduce you now to Carl Oglesby of the SDS.
1156,TOM,(to himself) Shit.
1157,KUNSTLER,And?
1158,TOM,The police were shoving Rennie away.
1159,OFFICER,This doesn't concern you!
1160,RENNIE,Just leave the kid alone! He'll come down!
1161,OFFICER #2,I know who you are! Step back!
1162,TOM,Rennie was just trying to get the police off of the kid.
1163,KUNSTLER,Get the police off of the kid.
1164,TOM,Yes.
1165,KUNSTLER,How?
1166,TOM,He was--
1167,KUNSTLER,--grabbing them? 140.
1168,RENNIE,Jesus!
1169,TOM,Outa nowhere--
1170,TOM,It was six armed police officers versus Rennie Davis and a pocket protector so I can understand that response.
1171,KUNSTLER,"How 'bout your response. Let's press ""Play”."
1172,FROINES,"I'd like to say to the police back there that we have--we're allowed to be here, we have a permit for-- we need medics back there. 141."
1173,KUNSTLER,Dellinger tried to stop you from saying what you were about to say to the crowd.
1174,TOM,Rennie's been beaten.
1175,DAVE,We can--listen to me--we can still get everybody out of here safely.
1176,TOM,No we can't.
1177,DAVE,Tell 'em to stay calm.
1178,TOM,No.
1179,DAVE,They'll listen to you.
1180,KUNSTLER,Did you tell 'em to stay calm?
1181,TOM,Rennie Davis has just been beaten by the police! Rennie's skull has been cracked open. 142.
1182,KUNSTLER,Did you tell your crowd to stay calm or did you--
1183,TOM,Bill--
1184,KUNSTLER,"I'm Richard Schultz and John Mitchell told me to win, Tom. Did you tell your crowd to stay calm or did you say--"
1185,TOM,Yes. Absolutely. If blood is going to flow--
1186,TOM,(shouting into the microphone) --let it flow all over the city!
1187,DAVE,Goddammit Tom!
1188,TOM,"(into the microphone) If gas is going to be used, let it come down all over Chicago! We're going to the Convention!"
1189,TOM,Let's get on the street! Get on the street!
1190,KUNSTLER,"""If blood is going to flow, let it flow all over the city.” Was that an order to start a peaceful demonstration? 143."
1191,KUNSTLER,"Once you'd had a moment to settle down, did you try top stop people?"
1192,KUNSTLER,You didn't try to stop anyone.
1193,TOM,No.
1194,TOM,(shouting) The bridges! Head to the bridges! The bridges! 144.
1195,KUNSTLER,You were the one who told people to go to the footbridges.
1196,TOM,The ones who were able to make it out of the park without getting arrested or maimed.
1197,KUNSTLER,"And those people, the ones you sent to the footbridges, did they know what was waiting for them on the other side?"
1198,KUNSTLER,All access to the convention was blocked.
1199,TOM,By an armored division. 145.
1200,KUNSTLER,"Of the Illinois National Guard, they're the good guys."
1201,TOM,"Jeeps fitted with concertina wire called Daley Dozers, and when did I stop being one of the good guys?"
1202,KUNSTLER,Let's find out. Were glass bottles being thrown at the police?
1203,DAVE,"Shit, no!"
1204,DAVE,(shouting) Don't throw anything! Drop the bottles! Don't throw anything!
1205,TOM,Some people threw bottles. Dave was the one trying to shut it down. They were frustrated--all three footbridges were--
1206,KUNSTLER,"You, Abbie, Jerry and 11 others eluded the police."
1207,TOM,"I wouldn't say we eluded them, I'd say we were fleeing from them."
1208,KUNSTLER,You found an unguarded bridge. 146.
1209,ABBIE,Now here's where things got weird.
1210,KUNSTLER,"You, Abbie, Jerry and 11 others found the only way to the convention."
1211,ABBIE,"In the lobby of the Hilton, right next to the Convention Center, is a bar called the Haymarket Tavern. The Haymarket Tavern is a watering hole for Chicago's political class and their hookers. And the place was packed to watch Humphrey getting the nomination a mile away."
1212,DELEGATE,"Mr. Chairman, the great state of Ohio, the Buckeye State--"
1213,PATRONS,(toasting) The Buckeye State! 147.
1214,ABBIE,One side of the Haymarket Tavern is a huge picture window with smoked glass. You can't see inside from the street.
1215,KUNSTLER,"You made it through the riot police, the tear gas, the national guard and you're in sight of the Convention Center--"
1216,TOM,Where we got trapped.
1217,KUNSTLER,What's another word for trapped?
1218,TOM,We were trapped between the window and the police.
1219,KUNSTLER,"What's another word for trapped? (beat) ""Caught”, right? 148."
1220,ABBIE,"Inside the bar it's like the 60's never happened. Outside the bar, the 60's were being performed for anyone who looked out the window."
1221,BAR PATRON #1,Does anyone know what a buckeye is?
1222,WOMAN,(trying to get his attention) Hey.
1223,BAR PATRON #2,A buckeye?
1224,BAR PATRON #1,Yeah.
1225,WOMAN,Am I the only one who sees what's going on out there?
1226,BAR PATRON #2,A buckeye is a nut. A poisonous nut.
1227,ABBIE,And we see a cop do something you don't ever want to see a cop do. 149.
1228,KUNSTLER,"All those people, how come you and Abbie and Jerry are the only ones who saw them do that?"
1229,TOM,I don't know. It was dark. People were scared.
1230,ABBIE,60's outside the bar. 50's inside the bar. And then...? An unnecessary metaphor.
1231,BAR PATRON #2,(over the noise) It's a nut?
1232,BAR PATRON #1,What?
1233,BAR PATRON #2,(louder) A nut!
1234,KUNSTLER,Were you resisting arrest? 150.
1235,TOM,They pushed us through the window.
1236,KUNSTLER,You overrun the riot police--
1237,KUNSTLER,"--make it past the tear gas,        (simultaneously) make it past the national        Which is more than Rennie can guard, find an open bridge,      say! Over 400 people admitted you can practically reach        to area hospitals with severe your hand out and touch the      injuries! They had armored convention and you gave          vehicles! Bayonets! They took yourself up peacefully?          off their name tags and badges! We were trying to protest peacefully at the fucking convention!"
1238,POLICEMAN,Hands behind your back.
1239,TOM,(pause) Yeah.
1240,KUNSTLER,"Who started the riot, Tom?"
1241,TOM,"(pause) ""Our”."
1242,KUNSTLER,(pause) What? 151.
1243,TOM,"(beat) ""Our”. ""Our blood”."
1244,ABBIE,"(pause) ""Our” blood. If ""our” blood is going to flow--you meant to say, ""If 'our' blood is going to flow, let it flow all over the city.” You didn't mean the cops, you were saying if they're going to beat us up then everyone should see it."
1245,KUNSTLER,(quietly) Jesus Christ.
1246,ABBIE,"You do this-- (to KUNSTLER) He does this, it's a pattern. Read his portion of the Port Huron Statement. He implies possessive pronouns and he uses vague noun modifiers."
1247,TOM,(pause) You read the Port Huron Statement?
1248,ABBIE,I've read everything you've published.
1249,TOM,I didn't know that.
1250,ABBIE,You're a talented guy. Except for the possessive pronouns and the vague--
1251,TOM,I know.
1252,TOM,(to KUNSTLER) Put Abbie on the stand instead.
1253,JUDGE HOFFMAN,Would you state your full name for the record please.
1254,ABBIE,It's Abbie.
1255,JUDGE HOFFMAN,Your last name.
1256,ABBIE,My grandfather's name was Shaboysnakoff but he was a Russian Jew protesting anti-semitism so he was assigned a name that would sound like yours.
1257,JUDGE HOFFMAN,What is your date of birth?
1258,ABBIE,"Psychologically, 1960."
1259,JUDGE HOFFMAN,What were you doing until 1960?
1260,ABBIE,Nothing really. It's called an American education.
1261,JUDGE HOFFMAN,Why don't we just proceed with the testimony.
1262,ABBIE,Sure.
1263,KUNSTLER,Do you know why you're on trial here?
1264,ABBIE,We carried certain ideas across state lines. Not machine guns or drugs or little girls. (MORE) 153.
1265,ABBIE,"When we crossed from New York to New Jersey to Pennsylvania to Ohio to Illinois, we had certain ideas. And for that, we were gassed, beaten, arrested and put on trial. In 1861, Lincoln said in his Inaugural address that, ""When the people shall grow weary of their Constitutional right to amend their government, they shall exert their revolutionary right to dismember and overthrow that government.” And if Lincoln had given that speech in Lincoln Park last summer he'd be on trial with the rest of us."
1266,KUNSTLER,How do you overthrow and dismember a government peacefully?
1267,ABBIE,In this country we do it every four years.
1268,KUNSTLER,That's all.
1269,SCHULTZ,So Chicago was just a massive voter registration drive.
1270,ABBIE,(laughs) Yeah.
1271,SCHULTZ,Did you hear the tape that was played in court of Mr. Hayden at the bandshell?
1272,ABBIE,Yes.
1273,SCHULTZ,You heard the tape?
1274,ABBIE,Yes. 154.
1275,SCHULTZ,That your plans for the convention were specifically designed to draw the police into a confrontation.
1276,ABBIE,If I'd known it was going to be the first wish of mine that came true I would've aimed higher.
1277,SCHULTZ,It's a yes or no question. When you came to Chicago were you hoping for a confrontation with the police?
1278,SCHULTZ,I'm concerned that you have to think about it.
1279,ABBIE,"Gimme me a moment, would you friend? I've never been on trial for my thoughts before."
1280,BAILIFF,All rise.
1281,BAILIFF,"69 CR 180, United States of America versus David Dellinger et al. 157."
1282,JUDGE HOFFMAN,The law requires that before sentencing I allow the defendant or defendants to make a statement to the Court. I've advised defense counsel that the Court will allow one defendant to speak for the group and I've been advised that the group has chosen Mr. Hayden. Is that right?
1283,TOM,(standing) Yes sir.
1284,JUDGE HOFFMAN,"In spite of your actions during the convention, you are the one defendant who has shown during this trial, respect for this court and for this country and remorse for your actions. I truly believe--I mean this--I truly believe that one day you could be a very productive part of our system. I'd like you to make your statement brief and without any political content of any kind. If you make your statement brief, if you make it respectful, remorseful and to the point, I will look favorably upon that when administering my sentence. Do you understand what I just said?"
1285,JUDGE HOFFMAN,Mr. Hayden?
1286,TOM,Yes. (pause) You'll look favorably in sentencing.
1287,JUDGE HOFFMAN,Yes.
1288,TOM,(pause) If I make my statement respectful and remorseful. 158.
1289,JUDGE HOFFMAN,Yes.
1290,TOM,"And I'm sorry, Your Honor, what was the third one?"
1291,JUDGE HOFFMAN,Brief.
